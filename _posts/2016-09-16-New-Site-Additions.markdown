<h1>New Site Additions Comming Soon</h1>
<article>
<p>We are adding new stuff to the Program13 website!!! With new developers
comes new material. The new developer will be revealed in an upcoming post but
for now we will talk about some new additions coming to the site in the next
few weeks. As many of you have already noticed, our chemistry page is almost 
untouched... That's where our new team member comes in. We will be expanding 
the Chemistry page massively to include a very large variety of chemical 
compounds. Some of these compounds may be very familiar to most of you but
we will also be adding some of the less known interesting chemical compounds.
</p>
<br/>
<p>It is our goal to eventually have an entire chemical database for our 
members to view and learn with. With every new addition comes a new 
opportunity to learn something new and expand their horizons. We look 
forward bringing you more information on the topic of chemistry and hope 
you enjoy our upcoming database.</p>
<br/>
<p>If you would like to add some information to our chemical database please
upload your files via our upload page.</p>
