title: New Updates Coming Soon
---
We have recently added a couple of minor updates. Pages that were not functional have been removed temporarily. They will be readded once they are completed.  We will also be adding a few more games to the 'Gamers' section. If you would like a specific game to be added please let us know. We will most likely not be adding games that are exclusive to one console just yet. We will add 'universal' games first. (The only exception being if one of our users submits a section already formated (HTML and CSS only please), in which case it will be uploaded immediately upon approval.) There <ins>may</ins> also be a section added providing some helpful coding examples for Python and C++. (If you would like to see examples in other programming languages, please submit them via the 'Contact Us' page or email them directly to Program13 via the link at the bottom of this page.) The coding examples section is still in the works so it may not be released with the next update, but, hopefully we can release it soon. And of course, as always, if you would like to contribute to our site, or if you have any suggestions, please contact us via the 'Contact Us' page.
