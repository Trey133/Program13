We would like to officially welcome you to our blog page! While the site is still a work in progress, 
we decided to start sharing all the cool stuff we find on the internet in real time with our members. 
It is our goal to bring you as much information about whatever random subject intrests us at a perticular time,
and what better way to do that than with our very own blog page? If you have a subject you would like us to
investigate or study furher please let us know and your idea could wind up on our site.

We strongly encourage our members to help with the idea process and even the research if they are interested.
The best way to learn as a community is to teach as a community, so please feel free to share your ideas or useful
tidbits of random knowledge. If you would like to add something to our site please visit the "Contact Us" page and
 send us a message or visit the "File Share" page and send us a file for our library. 

Thank you for all of your help and support. We hope to hear from you soon! :)
