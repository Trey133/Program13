With all the hype about social media these days, Program13 has decided to jump onboard the band wagon. I know, I know, it's all rediculous. It's essentially a popularity contest but but without having to be 'popular' in real life. Whatever you may feel about the subject we invite you to join us on our new pages.
</p>
<p>
We have added out social media logos to the bottom of our website to make it easier for you to find our pages. So far all we have is <a href="" target="_blank">Twitter</a>, <a href="" target="_blank">GitHub</a>, and <a href="" target="_blank">Youtube</a>. Sorry Facebook junkies but we probably won't be creating a Facebook page. Facebook is last years news and we'd rather not participate in mass information gathering by private companies and of course let's not forget about googd ol' Uncle Sam.

<p>
Anyways... The moral of the story is, we are trying to expand our reach and share our project with the world. As you all already know, we here at Program13 think everyone should try to learn as much as possible about every subject that sparks their interest. If this was everyones goal, imagine what we as a human race could accomplish?? But not I'm not trying to get to philisophical just trying to spread the word. So please join us on our social media sites and feel free to send us a message. We always look forward to hearing from our fans.
