<p>Al Capone rose to infamy as a gangster in Chicago during the 1920s and early 1930s. The Bureau of Investigation 
(the FBI’s predecessor) joined the Bureau of Prohibition and other agencies in investigating Capone. In 1931, Capone was 
sentenced to prison for tax evasion. Suffering from a case of syphilis that left him too mentally ill to resume his 
previous criminal activities, he was paroled in 1939 and settled in Florida, where he lived until his death in 1947.</p>
