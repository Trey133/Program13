    <li>Be watchful of the time, for there are a limited number of hours in the day. Always be on time to your appointed place.</li>
    <br />

    <br />
    <li>Keep your appearance decent in public at all times.</li>
    <br />
    <li>Take care of your own house before you take care of the houses of others - make your bed in the morning.</li>
    <br />
    <li>Don't preced your spoken words with "let me be honest" or "real talk".</li>
    <br />
    <li>You should never make assumptions.</li>
    <br />
    <li>Give your time to those things which are inmportant.</li>
    <br />
    <li>In order to get the work done, you must show up.</li>
    <br />
    <li>Learn how to live with rejection. Rejection is not always defeat.</li>
    <br />
    <li>Learn to say "okay" convincingly - it is not the most important thing to win an argument...Sometimes you gain more in defeat.</li>
    <br />
    <li>Shake handes, look people in the eye. You can tell a lot about a man from his grip.</li>
    <br />
    <li>You should know your craft like the back of your hand.</li>
    <br />
    <li>Remain selfless in serving others.</li>
    <br />
    <li>Make excellence a habit. After the rest of the team finishes its grind, you must continue grinding.</li>
    <br />
    <li>Rise early in the morning and work late into the night.</li>
    <br />
    <li>Never be afraid to try and never be afraid to fail.</li>
    <br />
    <li>Talk to people as if you have known them all your life.</li>
    <br />
    <li>The people behind the scenes have name - learn their names because they are just as important as the ones who are out front.</li>
    <br />
    <li>Learn to control your impulses and emotions - be slow to anger.</li>
    <br />
    <li>Surround yourself with those who are walking in the path of the light. Successful people don't hang around broke people.</li>
    <br />
    <li>Provide no excuses. Provide an explanation only if it is required, but do offer an appology if the fault or error is found to be yours.</li>
    <br />
    <li>Men should always respect women for they are the vessel in which new light is created. When you seek a mate, find the highest quality vessel to bear the light.</li>
    <br />
    <li>Beware of the watchers and keep a close eye on your enemy.</li>
    <br />
    <li>Accept the qualities of a person, even the bad ones, when they show you who they are.</li>
    <br />
    <li>Know more than one way home. Mix it up. Take different routes/paths.</li>
    <br />
    <li>Use the light to make decisions - Be decisive when the time comes.</li>
    <br />
    <li>Tell no lies and do not share the secrets of others.</li>
    <br />
    <li>Pursue the calling of your light - chase your passions and live your dreams for the Greater Light requires this.</li>
    <br />
    <li><ins>Keep these Laws, these Lessons and your commitments for there are consequences to breaking the Laws, Lessons, and your commitments. Write the Laws upon your heart. Live as if your life depended on them. The path to success is guaranteed if you keep the Laws.</ins></li>
