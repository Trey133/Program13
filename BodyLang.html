<h1><ins>The Two Types of Smokers</ins></h1>
<article>
<p>   There are two basic types of smokers - addicted smokers and
social smokers.</p>
<p>Studies show that smaller, quicker puffs on a cigarette stimulate
the brain, giving a heightened level of awareness whereas
longer, slower puffs act as a sedative. Addicted smokers are
dependent on the sedative effects of nicotine to help them deal
with stress and they take longer, deeper puffs and will also
smoke alone. Social smokers usually smoke only in the presence
of others or 'when I have a few drinks'. This means that
this smoking is a social display to create certain impressions
on others. In social smoking, from the time the cigarette is lit
until it's extinguished it's being smoked for only 20% of the
time in shorter, quicker puffs while the other 80% is devoted
to a series of special body language gestures and rituals.</p>
<br/>
<p>A study conducted by Andy Parrot of the University of East
London reports that 80% of smokers say they feel less stressed
when they smoke. However, the stress levels of adult smokers
are only slightly higher than those of non-smokers anyway,
and stress levels increase as the smokers develop a regular
smoking habit. Parrot also found that stopping smoking actually
leads to a reduction of stress. Science now shows that
smoking is not an aid for mood control because nicotine
dependency heightens stress levels. The supposed relaxing
effect of smoking only reflects the reversal of the tension and
irritability that develops during a smoker's nicotine depletion.
In other words, the smoker's mood is normal during smoking,
and stressed when not smoking. That means that for a smoker
to feel normal, the smoker must always have a lit cigarette in
his mouth! Furthermore, when smokers quit smoking, they
gradually become less stressed over time. Smoking reflects the
reversal effect of the tension and stress caused by the lack of
nicotine in the blood.</p><br/>
<p>Studies show poor moods occur during the first few weeks
after quitting, but there is dramatic improvement once the
nicotine is completely gone from the body, reducing craving
for the drug and the stress that results from it.</p>
<br/>
<p>Even though smoking is now banned in many places and contexts,
it's an advantage to understand the connection between
smoking body language signals and a person's attitude.
Smoking gestures play an important part in assessing emotional
states as they are usually performed in a predictable
ritualistic manner that can give important clues to the
smoker's state of mind or to what they are trying to achieve.
The cigarette ritual involves tapping, twisting, flicking, waving
and other mini-gestures indicating that the person is experiencing
more tension than may be normal.</p>

<h2>Differences Between Men and Women</h2>
<article>
<br/>
<p>When women smoke they will often hold the cigarette high
with their wrist bent back in a wrist display gesture, leaving
the front of the body open. When men smoke they keep their
wrist straight to avoid looking effeminate and drop their
smoking hand down below chest level after they puff, keeping
the front of the body protected at all times.
Twice as many women smoke as men and both sexes take
the same number of puffs per cigarette, but men hold the
smoke in their lungs longer, making them more susceptible to
lung cancer than women.</p>
<br/>
<p>Men will often use the Pinch Hold when smoking, especially if
they are trying to be secretive, keeping the cigarette hidden
inside the palm. This gesture is commonly used in the movies
by actors who play tough guys or who are acting sneaky or
suspicious.</p>

<h2>Smoking as a Sexual Display</h2>
<article>
<p>Films and media advertising have always portrayed smoking as
sexy. Smoking is another opportunity to emphasise our sex
differences: it allows a woman to use wrist displays (we'll
discuss this in Chapter 15) and open her body to a man and it
allows the cigarette to be used like a small phallus being seductively
sucked between her lips. A man can highlight his
masculinity by holding the cigarette secretively and seductively.
Previous generations used a seductive smoking ritual as
an acceptable form of courtship with a man offering to light a
woman's cigarette while she touched his hand and held his
gaze longer than usual as she thanked him. In many places
today, however, smoking is as popular as a fart in a spacesuit
so the smoking courtship ritual is virtually dead. The key to
the perceived female sexual attraction behind smoking is the
submissive attitude it implies; in other words, it carries the
subtle message that a woman who smokes can be persuaded to
do things that are not in her best interests. While blowing
smoke in a person's face is unacceptable everywhere, in Syria
it's seen as a sexual invitation when a man does it to a woman!</p>

<h2>How to Spot a Positive or Negative Decision</h2>
<br/>
<article>
<p>Whether a person has a positive or negative attitude towards
his circumstances is revealed by the direction in which his
smoke is exhaled, whether it's up or down. We are assuming
here that the smoker is not blowing the smoke upwards to
avoid offending others and that he could have blown the
smoke in either direction. A person who is feeling positive
superior or confident about what he sees or hears will blow the
smoke in an upward direction most of the time. Conversely, a
person in a negative, secretive or suspicious frame of mind will
blow the smoke down most of the time. Blowing down and
from the corner of the mouth indicates an even more negative
or secretive attitude.</p>
<br/>
<p>In films, the leader of a motorcycle gang or criminal syndicate
is usually portrayed as a tough, aggressive man who, as he
smokes, tilts his head back sharply and with controlled precision
blows the smoke towards the ceiling to demonstrate his
superiority to the rest of the gang. In contrast, Humphrey
Bogart was often cast as a gangster or tough guy who held his
cigarette inverted in his hand and blew the smoke down from
the corner of his mouth as he planned a jailbreak or other
devious activity. There also appears to be a relationship
between how positive or negative the person feels and the
speed at which he exhales the smoke. The faster the smoke is
blown upwards the more superior or confident; the faster it is
blown down, the more negative he feels.</p><br/>
<p>If a smoker is playing cards and is dealt a good hand, he is
likely to blow the smoke upwards, whereas a poor hand may
cause him to blow it downwards. While some card players use
a 'poker face' when playing cards as a way of not showing any
body signals that may give them away, other players like to be
actors and use misleading body language to lull the other
players into a false sense of security. If, for example, a poker
player was dealt four of a kind and he wanted to bluff the
other players, he could throw the cards face down on the table
in disgust, curse, cross his arms and put on a non-verbal
display indicating he'd been dealt a poor hand. But then he
quietly sits back and draws on his cigarette and blows the
smoke upwards. And then he Steeples. It would be unwise for
the other players to now bet on the next hand, as they would
probably be beaten. Observation of smoking gestures in
selling situations shows that when smokers are asked to buy,
those who have already reached a positive decision blow the
smoke upwards, whereas those who have decided not to buy,
blow downwards.</p><br/>
<p>The original study of smokers we carried out in 1978
showed that smokers took significantly longer to reach a decision
in a negotiation than non-smokers and that the smoking
ritual is performed most often during the tense moments of
the negotiations. Smokers, it seems, are able to stall decisionmaking
by diverting their attention to the smoking process. So
if you want quicker decisions from smokers, negotiate in a
room that displays a large 'No Smoking' sign.</p>

<h2>Cigar Smokers</h2>
<br/>
<article>
<p>Cigars have always been used as a means of displaying superiority
because of their cost and size. The big-time business
executive, the gang leader and those in high-status positions
are often portrayed as smoking cigars. Cigars are used to celebrate
a victory or achievement such as the birth of a baby, a
wedding, clinching a business deal or winning the lottery. It is
not surprising that most of the smoke exhaled by cigar
smokers is blown upwards. At a celebration dinner where
cigars were distributed freely we noted that of 400 recorded
cigar smoke exhalations, 320 were in an upward direction.</p>

<h2>How Smokers End a Session</h2>
<article>
<p>Most smokers smoke their cigarette down to a certain length
before extinguishing it in an ashtray. Women tend to slowly stub
the cigarette out while men are likely to crush it with the thumb.
If the smoker lights a cigarette and suddenly extinguishes it
earlier than he normally would, he has signalled his decision to
terminate the conversation. Watching for this termination
signal can allow you to take control or to close the conversation,
making it appear that it was your idea to end things.</p>
