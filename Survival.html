<h2 id="Fire"><ins>Primitive Fire and Cordage</ins></h2><article>
<p>The learning of the necessary "skills" to live directly with nature, eliminating
the need of intermediaries, isn't really all that difficult. You learn a little
about this aspect...a bit about that one...and then another. Pretty soon you
find that most of them overlap and the further you get along in your natural
education, the easier it is to learn.</p>
<p>Many years ago when I first got serious about putting all this together
(my first step was to get rid of the TV, and then electricity), I felt that if I
were to learn a few of the basic primitive "survival" skills, I'd really become
quite the woodsman. I soon found that the more that I learned, the more
I still had to learn. I read (and I urge anyone interested in learning to also
read) everything that I could lay my hands on that deals with living with
nature. There's a lot written on all aspects of it—some poor, some superb,
but most lying somewhere in the middle.</p>
<p>Before you can decide what's workable, you'll have to get out and
work with it. Reading only goes so far. When you actually begin to put into
practice what you're reading, then it becomes obvious just who knows what
he or she is writing about.</p>
<p>No special talent is needed here—only the ability to follow a bunch of
natural rules (physics). Any of the primitive skills, today as well as yesterday,
can be carried to the extreme and become an art. I'm far from being expert
in woodsmanship. I have, though, taught myself what I need to know to go
"naked into the wilderness" and not only survive but before long be living
fairly comfortably (unless, of course, I froze to death first). I refer to my
teachings as primitive "living" skills, not "survival" skills, though they can
be used in that concept. I have taught myself to be proficient in these
skills—not to be an artist.</p>
<p>Since 1987 I've made thousands of fires with the bow and drill and
with the hand-drill methods. So I'm proficient enough in this to teach it
to others. The same holds true with the making of cordage. The more you
learn, the more you realize what there is to learn—but the easier it becomes
to learn it.</p>
<h2><ins>Bow Drill and Hand Drill</ins></h2>
<p>The basic principle of making fire with either a bow or a hand drill is really
very simple. The amount of practice needed to develop that special touch
which enables you to regularly succeed in this is another thing entirely.
To say "make fire" with the bow or hand drill is really a misnomer.</p>
<p>Actually, what's accomplished is that the wooden drill spinning on another
piece of wood creates friction, which creates dust, and eventually things
get hot enough that a spark is created. The compressed pile of dust that has
been formed becomes like the hot tip of a cigarette that's placed into a pile
of tinder and coaxed into a flame.</p>
<p>Simple? Yeh, really it is. I've had students "make fire" within minutes of
being exposed to this procedure, and understand just what they were doing.
I'll first show you how to make fire (bow drill first, and hand drill a
little later). I'll quickly describe the necessary components and the steps to
follow. Then we'll get down to brass tacks and go through it again, dwelling
a bit more on how to assemble the parts and to put it all together. When you
finish with this, you'll be able to make fire.</p>
<p>We have five components:</p> <p>(1) the bow, a limber stick about 30" long;</p> <p>(2)
the drill and</p> <p>(3) the fireboard, both of which are softwoods;</p> <p>(4) a cup, called
a "bearing block," in which the upper end of the drill is placed to keep it
from drilling through the palm of your hand; and finally</p> <p>(5) the bowstring,
which will be covered in greater detail later in this book.</p>
<h2><ins>Simplified Directions for Making a Bow Drill</ins></h2>
<p>We take a knife and cut a notch and a slight depression into the fireboard,
twist the drill into the string of the bow, place one end of the drill into the
depression of the fireboard,
place the bearing block on top
of the drill, and spin the drill
by pushing the bow back and
forth till a spark is formed. We
finish by dropping the spark
into a prepared "bird's nest" of
tinder and gently blowing it into
flame.</p> Easy?...sure. And you
might be able to make it work
with no more information than
this. Some 13 years ago, three
of us spent the better part of a
day wearing ourselves out with
no more information than what
you've just read—and eventually
made fire.</p>
<h2><ins id="Bow">Parts of a Bow </h2></ins>
<p>Now I'll go into more detail about all the parts—the whats and the
whys, how to gather the parts, and how to fashion them under primitive
conditions. The special touch you'll have to develop yourself through
practice (it does come pretty easily).</p>
<p>BOW—</p><>This is the easiest part to obtain. A reasonably limber stick (limb
or piece of brush), 1/2" to 3/4" thick, approximately 30" long. It needs to
be limber enough to create just the right amount of tension on the string
when the drill's inserted. Too limber and you'll have trouble with the string
slipping on the drill. Too stiff and too much stress will be placed on the
string and the drill, resulting in the drill's continually flying out on you, and
most often the string's breaking. (Believe me, the stress created on the string
and the drill is nothing compared to the stress that'll be building in you at
this point!)</p> <p>The length of about 30" is also important, though a bow of only
a few inches, or even one of several feet, would work, just not as well. At
that length the bow isn't too cumbersome and will allow for a good, full
sweep of the entire length. This is critically important, as every time the bow
stops to change directions, everything cools off a tiny bit, thus impeding
your efforts.</p>
<p id="Drill">DRILL—</p><p>We now need to be a bit more particular. A softwood is
necessary. Also, dead and dry (I'll mention damp wood later). Literally
dozens of woods will work for a drill. Cottonwood, aspen, and yucca are my
favorites, not only because they work well but also because they're abundant
in the parts of the country where I live and travel. Willow is a favorite
among many firemakers. I've heard that sage works well too, as do box
elder and hackberry. The smaller limbs and sapwood of cedar, locust, and
ash would be fine (though the heartwoods of these are too hard). The list
goes on. I've been told and have read to avoid resinous woods, such as pine.
Cedar works, at least in some parts of the country. Experiment with what's
available to you. Members of the cottonwood family (including birch, aspen,
and poplar) can be found in most parts of the country; all of them work
superbly. Search out dead limbs, preferably off the ground (to eliminate
absorption of ground moisture) and with bark weathered away. Check the
condition of the wood by pressing it with your thumbnail. If it makes a slight
indentation easily without crumbling, it should be about right. Also, if it
breaks easily and cleanly with a snap, it has no greenness or moisture left in
it. The drill needs to be about as small around as your little finger up to as
big as your thumb. No real exactness here, though I wouldn't go much for
larger or smaller (since a smaller drill spins more with each pass of the bow,
thereby creating friction faster but also drilling through the fireboard faster,
sometimes before the spark has formed).</p>
<p>The ideal length of the drill is 6" to 8". Too long and it's hard to manage,
too short and your bow hand gets in the way of the drill and you can't see
what is happening. And straight, since if there's a warp in the drill, it'll
wobble as it spins and create problems. Most times a slightly curved drill can
be straightened with your knife.</p>
<p>A fresh drill (here, yucca; my favorite combination is a yucca drill on a
cottonwood fireboard). The right side is more pointed for the bearing block. The
slight tit on the left helps it to stay where it belongs in the fireboard till the hole's
enlarged.</p>
<p id="Fireboard">FIREBOARD—</p><p>The fireboard can, but need not, be the same material
as the drill. Usually, it will be. Again, it must be a softwood. Check its
condition, which should be the same as for the drill. The size of the board is
variable. It need only be larger in width than the diameter of the drill. I like
to make mine from 1 1/2" to 2" wide (remember that nothing here is exact).
Take the limb of your choosing and split it in half, using your knife. Shave
the split side till the board will lie flat, shave down the round side till the
board is about 1/2" thick, and then square up the sides.</p>
<p>BEARIN G BLOCK—</p><p>This is a very simple piece, and an important
one, but one not all that easy to come up with in a survival situation. For
at-home work, I suggest a 1 oz. shot glass, which fits the hand comfortably,
has a hole of the right size for the drill, and has a surface as smooth as you'll
find (with the goal of eliminating friction). You can also find a semisoft rock
and drill a 1/2" to 3/4" hole in it about 1/2" deep, then lubricate it up with
Crisco ("bear grease in a can"). You need to eliminate the friction at this
end. (I have in the past used various knots of hardwoods. Some of them,
though, had soft spots in them and I was coming up with smoke from my
palm before the fireboard!) I carry with and use at home, in demonstrations,
and in base camps a rock about 3" x 2 1/2" x 1 1/2" thick with a dandy hole
in it, though it's pretty hefty to carry around in the timber. For now, this is all
you need to know. We'll go into obtaining this under primitive conditions a
bit later.</p>
<p>Since there's a definite satisfaction in taking your first ever-spark created
with the bow drill and blowing it into flame, let's have you gather up and
prepare some tinder at this time. Let's make up a batch. I really like the dry
inner bark of cedar (cottonwood is good, also), plus some dry, fine grasses.
Roll these around in your hands till it's fine as a cotton ball. You won't need
much; a small handful will be plenty. Form a hole in it like a bird's nest.
Place this on a piece of bark or cardboard (so that when it bursts into flame
you won't barbecue your hand).</p>
<h2 id="startafire"><ins>Using Your Bow Drill</ins></h2>
<p>With the information contained thus far, you're ready to "make fire." We'll
run you through it once now. The information presented below is certainly
useful (or I wouldn't have gone to the trouble to write it), but it deals mostly
with gathering the materials under primitive conditions.</p>
<p>BOW—</p><p>Archers, string your bow! Almost any cordage will work, but
it should be strong and not too thin, as it will tend to break easily with
the first-timer. Also, the heavier cordage (not rope) seems to get more of a
grip on the drill. Here I'd suggest using a "rawhide" (not genuine rawhide)
boot lace, which is about ideal. I twist mine tight, which seems to grab the
drill that much better. In short order, you'll begin to feel precisely the right
amount of tension. The string will stretch considerably with use, especially
at first, and adjustments will have to be made as you go along. The bow
is not strung tight; considerable slack is left. When the drill is placed in
the bow, the slack is taken up (note top photo on page 9). Remember, the
tension must be just so; too tight is worse than only a little slack, but there
isn't much room for variables here.</p>
<p>DRILL—</p><p>Now let's take our selected piece for the drill. I like to point
the upper end a bit (the end that goes into the bearing block). When
breaking in a new hole in the fireboard (as in this case), I find it easier to
operate if I carve the working end into a slight "tit" (study photos on page 9).
Doing this gives it a tendency to take a bit longer to mate the drill to the
hole, but also assists in keeping the drill from kicking out of the fireboard
while the depression enlarges to fit the drill. By the time the two mate, the
hole and the drill fit better.</p>
<p>Bow (in this case a piece of dogwood) strung with deer rawhide. I always string
the drill the same way, resulting in the top of the drill being up and the drill
ending up on the outside of the string, thereby staying out of the way of the
bow hand.</p>
<p>FIREBOARD—</p><p>Now take hold of the piece prepared for this. There
are two approaches to take here. I'll talk you through one and mention the
other. Both work.</p>
<p>With your knife, cut a "V" notch approximately 1/4" to 5/16" wide
extending into the board almost half the diameter of the drill (see photo
below). At the point of the "V" of this notch, dig out a slight depression for
the end of the drill to fit into. (The other method is to dig your depression
first and then, after the hole has been started with the drill, to cut the
notch.) The depression must be in far enough so that when the hole is
started, the notch retains enough material at the wide part of the "V" (at the
edge of the board) to prevent the drill from kicking out. If the drill does kick
out, breaking off this retainer (which helps to hold the drill), you may as
well begin a new hole, as if you don't you'll encounter only frustration.</p>
<p>Now, let's get serious. Place a piece of bark (you nonprimitives can
use cardboard) under the notch cut in the fireboard.</p> <p>This serves two
purposes:</p> <p>(1) to catch the dust and spark, enabling you to drop it into the
tinder, and</p><p>(2) to act as insulation between the fireboard or dust and the
ground, which may be damp, cool, or both, slowing down or preventing
spark creation.</p>
<p>The following instructions are for a right-hander; you southpaws, just
reverse the procedure.</p><p> Get down on your right knee (see photo next page).
Place the ball of your left foot on the fireboard, making certain that it's
secure and doesn't rock. An unsteady board can result in the knocking of
your dust pile all to hell. I like the notch to be about 2 1/2" to 3" out from
the inside of my foot, which is where my hand automatically falls into place
directly over the notch when my wrist is locked against my left calf. Wrap
the drill in the string (as noted in photo) and place the proper end into the
depression of the fireboard. Take the bearing block in your left hand, place
it on top of the drill, and lock your left wrist securely against your left calf
(this is important, as you want the hand holding the bearing block to be
completely steady; if it sways to and fro while drilling, you'll be inviting
trouble). All that's necessary now is to run the bow back and forth. At this
point you'll start developing the "feel" of what you're doing.</p>
<p>The amount of downward pressure applied to the drill, combined with
the speed of the bow, is what determines how much friction is created,
thus how quickly a spark is formed. When you first begin, don't even
think "fire"—instead, concentrate only on becoming comfortable with the
operation (kinda like chewing tobacco and walking at the same time). Make
smooth, full strokes with the bow, running it the entire length of the string.
Remember that every time you change directions, that split-second stop
cools things off just a little. Keep the drill perpendicular.</p>
<p>The string has a tendency to wander either up or down the drill while
spinning. Control this by pointing the end of the bow either slightly up or
down, whichever seems to work. The pressure that you're able to apply
with your thumb and fingers of the bow hand on the string will also help.
Before you begin to "make fire,"have all ingredients at hand. From left:
fireboard, drill, bearing block, strung bow, tinder, four piles of kindling in various
sizes, and, at far right, larger wood—all laid out on my vest to keep them from
absorbing ground moisture (the ground was wet).</p>
<p>Drill straight up
and down, with
left wrist locked
securely against
left calf.
Vary the amount of pressure on the drill. Begin with only a slight
amount and increase it as you become more comfortable. Too much
pressure, and things will want to bind up and the string to begin slipping on
the drill. Whenever this happens, you must let up on your pressure, because
no matter how fast the bow's moving, if the drill isn't spinning there's no
friction. If not enough pressure is applied, nothing will happen.</p>
<p>When beginning to mate a new drill to a new hole (what we're doing
here), there'll be a certain amount of drilling where nothing seems to be
happening. This can last from only several seconds to several minutes,
depending on the type and the condition of the wood. At first the drill
will spin smoothly, as if sliding on a freshly waxed floor. Then suddenly,
as the drill and fireboard begin to "mate," it will act as if you've gone from
the waxed floor to sandpaper. This difference you feel, and hear.
Now, control and feel become all-important. The drill, which to this
point was easy to control, suddenly becomes more difficult. You may find
that you need to slightly tilt the wrist holding the bearing block ever so
slightly one way and then the other as you run the bow back and forth, so
as to keep the drill from kicking out of the hole.</p>
<p>Right after the two mate, and the first smoke and dust appear,
I usually take a quick break before I go after the spark. This allows me
to catch my breath and relax my muscles so that when I start up again
I'm fresh. This often makes things a bit easier.</p>
<p>At this point, bear in mind that the hole isn't yet deep enough to
hold the drill on its own. It still will take some care on your part to keep
it from kicking out. Now that the friction has begun, the drill is slightly
more difficult to control. You'll feel this, in short order. Vary the amount
of downward pressure on the drill to coincide with the speed of the bow.
You will develop the feel.</p>
<p>Here's another very important tip. I had made fire this way for 11 years
before stumbling onto this technique, and now I can't imagine ever having
made fire successfully, regularly, without having applied it. As mentioned
before, the string will stretch while in use. A good, flexible bow will
compensate for a lot of this, but eventually the string will become so loose
that it slips on the drill when you apply the proper amount of pressure.
Once, just as the spark was about ready, my string began slipping badly.
Without thinking, I took the string between the first two fingers and the
thumb of the bow hand and took up enough slack so that I was able to
successfully finish. Now, anytime I take up the bow, the fingers and thumb
just naturally wrap on the string.</p>
<p>Note how I use my
thumb and fingers to
control string tension.
Use whatever's most
comfortable for you.</p>

<p>If you concentrate on keeping the drill perpendicular—the left wrist
locked tightly against the left calf, the bow taking long, smooth strokes,
the fireboard steady and not wobbling—the spark will form of itself. First
the smoke will begin, then dust will rise, then heavier smoke, and the
dust will get blacker. Keep yourself relaxed and merely concentrate on the
smoothness of the operation. There will be a spark.</p>
<p>Once the drill and hole mate, the spark will normally be created in
less than 30 seconds. Once, timing myself, I had a spark in 10 seconds. If
everything is working, it doesn't take long.</p>
<p>When you have your spark (most of the time it'll be hidden—the dust
pile's smoking is your sign), carefully lift away the drill and place it aside.
There's no big rush. I've left the smoldering dust for up to four minutes
while I went in search of tinder, and still had a fine coal. Pick up the bark
or cardboard holding the spark, fan it some with your hand, blow gently
on it, let any slight breeze help {not a wind strong enough to blow it away,
though). When it glows, drop it into your bird's nest of tinder. Fold the
tinder over the top and begin blowing the spark more and more as it gets
hotter. Suddenly...fire!</p>
<p>When I first began making fire this way, I had the tendency to wear
myself out by the time that the spark was formed. Someone else had to blow
it into flame because I would just blow the whole damn thing away. No need
for this. If you concentrate only on the control of the drill and the smooth
operation of the bow, taking extra care to remind yourself to remain calm
and relaxed, the spark will form on its own and you'll be left fresh enough
to easily blow the spark to flame. If you're getting winded, you're doing
something wrong.</p>
<p>Many times it seems that no matter what you do, a spark simply won't
come into being. The chances of this happening seem to rise proportionately
with the size of the crowd that you're demonstrating this to. But when—not
if—y°u
 do get that spark, whether it's the first or the hundredth, cherish
and glow with it. It's something that I never take for granted. Like calling
coyotes, there are so many things that can go wrong, yet each time it works I
feel a real sense of accomplishment.</p>
<h2 id="observationsbow">Some Observations on Using the Bow Drill</h2>
<br/>
<p>For the last few passes of the bow, some folks advise that you apply slightly
less pressure on the drill, to kick out the spark that may be under it. I usually
don't find this necessary, but if unsure of the spark I sometimes do it.
If I seem to have difficulty getting a sure spark, I often make several
furious passes with the bow at the last. I don't like to do this, though,
because it has the tendency to wind me. Then I lose control of the operation
at this point and the drill kicks out, knocking away the dust pile.</p>
<p>Usually you can tell that the spark has formed, because you'll see a wisp
of smoke rising from the dust, separate from the smoke created by the drill.
On occasion, the entire pile of dust will suddenly glow—a good sign!
A single hole in the fireboard is capable of many sparks. Before using it
again, it helps to slightly roughen the tip of the drill and the hole.
After several uses, especially with too tight a string, the drill will become
too "round," causing the string to slip. This is usually easily corrected by
carefully shaving it till it's once again unround.</p>
<p>Ear wax, or oil from your hair or the side of your nose, will help to
eliminate friction in the bearing block. Always remember that you're
eliminating friction at the bearing block, and creating it at the fireboard.
Avoid placing the wrong end of the drill into the fireboard, as that little
bit of oil can really foul things up.</p>
<p>Under damp conditions, find and use the driest woods available, and
get into the driest location that you can to work. If the wood's only damp, it
can still work, but it will take a lot longer. The spinning drill eventually will
dry things enough to work, though you'll have a lot of strikes against you.
Under primitive conditions, the hardest components to gather will
be the string (covered later) and the bearing block. Sometimes you'll find
a ready-made block in a stone with precisely the right depression, but
don't count on it. You might find a piece of bone that will work (say, from
the skulls of small critters). Also look for a piece of hardwood, possibly
containing a knot with a slight hole that you can easily enlarge. If you find
something that might work, you can form or enlarge the hole by using the
bow or drill. Use a hard piece of wood for the drill (or maybe you'll be lucky
enough to come up with a "natural" rock drill), definitely something harder
than the block material. Ingenuity and common sense help a lot.</p>
<p>To now explain to you how
to make fire with the hand
drill will be simple—at
least in theory. In practice,
though, you'll be faced with
a much greater challenge
than the bow or drill. The
basic principle remains
the same: to create friction
with a wooden drill on a
fireboard. The spinning of
the drill, the fireboard, the
notch, the dust, and the
spark—all seem somewhat
the same. But...</p>

<h2 id="partshanddrill">Parts of a Hand Dril</h2>
<p>DRILL—</p><p>The material for use here differs little from what we covered for
the bow drill, except that because of the extra difficulty in creating friction
here you need to be more choosy. The ideal length of a hand drill, for my
length arms, is about 18" to 24" . I usually begin with a few inches longer,
as this shortens quickly. Too long a drill and the top has a tendency to
whip around, causing you to lose control (so much more important here).
Too short, and you don't get the full benefit of a long downward run of the
hands before having to return to the top once again. I prefer a diameter of
about 1/4", to gain more revolutions of the drill for each sweep of the
hands (a drill that's too thin and limber will bend from the hands'
downward pressure).</p>

<p>FIREBOARD—</p><p>Again, the basic type is the same as for the bow or
drill. I'd been having trouble catching a spark, when someone suggested
a fireboard thinner than the one I'd been using. When I cut down the
cottonwood board that I had been using to about 1/4" to 3/8" , things
improved. With the softer yucca, I still keep the board about 1/2" thick.
With the hand drill, I begin the depression and hole before I cut the notch.
I also cut the notch slightly different than for the bow drill. I keep it closed
at the top, flaring it open toward the bottom of the fireboard (note photos on
page 20). I find that the drill has cut the hole below this point before things
get hot enough to matter, and that the closed top then forces more of the hot
dust into the notch, rather than letting it spill over the top.
Note that the last 1 1/2" of this cattail hand drill was slightly shaved, to remove
some but not all of the outer shell.</p>

<h2 id="usingyourdrill">Using Your Hand Drill</h2>
<p>To put this in action, get into a comfortable position. My left foot again
holds the fireboard, but your position may not be the same. For me, it's
slightly different. I need to place the foot out a bit further and drop my
knee out of the way somewhat, so that I can get a good full run of my
hands down the length of the drill. I use the side of my heel to hold the
board. Your hands must come down straight. You must keep the drill
perpendicular. By placing my foot and knee slightly different than for the
bow drill, I'm able to start my hands "rubbing" at the highest comfortable
point (in my case, 24" ) and to keep them going to a point about 6" above the
fireboard. Once you reach the lowest point, raise your hands again to the
top one at a time, so that you can keep constant downward pressure on
the drill. If any air is allowed to reach under the drill, it cools everything off.
Once both hands are up, repeat the procedure. Eventually the smoke, dust,
and spark will appear—though not all that easily.</p>
<p>This procedure will wear you out, I assure you. A completely new set of
muscles is at work here. After you've done this for 45 seconds or so, you'll
feel as if you've run the Boston Marathon, yet using your arms instead of
your legs. It's strenuous and it takes a lot of practice to get this operation
down smoothly, which it must be to be successful. I suggest that you do a
lot of practicing before you even think "fire." This is a bit more complicated
than chewing tobacco while walking. Here you must also juggle. It does take
practice, not only to get everything running smoothly, but also to get yourself
into some semblance of physical well-being. This does sap your energies.
(Anyhow, it does mine.) It also creates blisters on the palm of your hands,
which eventually will turn to calluses if worked at long enough. It took me
well over a month of daily workouts to develop a good set of calluses, which
a four-week vacation of "city living" took away.</p>
<h2 id="observationsdrill">Some Observations on Using the Hand Drill</h2>
<p>When you first attempt making fire with a hand drill, I suggest going
slow. Get the movements down to where everything runs smoothly and
automatically. Your hands clasp the drill at the top, you rub the drill
between your palms (keeping constant downward pressure), you keep the
drill perpendicular at all times, when your hands reach the bottom you grasp
the drill with the left hand's thumb and forefinger, you raise the right hand to
the top and hold the drill firmly while the left hand comes back up (thanks,
Bob!), then repeat...repeat...and repeat. Over and over, slowly at first, and
then speed up as it becomes more natural to you. Speed and downward
pressure are all-important.</p>
<p>Spitting on your hands helps retain a little extra "grip" on the drill
(thanks, Bryan!), allowing a few more spins before your hands reach bottom.
Always put the thickest end of the drill down, as this kinda slows the hands'
trip downward also.</p>
<p>My most commonly used drills are stems of cattail or mullein (thanks,
Dick!). Most of these stalks are just slightly bent, though. They must be
straight, so be selective. I know of one woodsman who uses only willow.
Since an ideal drill is sometimes difficult to find, a good idea is to make your
drill beforehand out of whatever wood you like (I prefer the dogwood that
I use for arrowshafts), then splice a tip of your choice for the working end.</p>
<p>I find that the outer shell at the base of the cattail is just enough tougher
than the inner portion that it tends to wear faster at the outer edges, leaving
a hole that looks like an anthill. It won't work this way. To compensate for
this, most times I'll find it necessary to slightly shave the outside. This takes
practice to remove precisely the right amount. Further up the stem, I don't
find this problem.</p>
<p>This is difficult for me to explain, and probably more difficult for many
of you to understand, but before my first sparks arrived with the hand drill
(they still don't come with regularity) my mind and body became "one"
with the drill and fireboard! You may or may not experience the same, but
this has happened in all cases when I've successfully gotten a spark with the
hand drill.</p>
<p>By using a longer drill
and superb teamwork,
two people can make this
easier by keeping the
drill spinning constantly.
It takes two working in
harmony—one set of
hands picking up the
drilling at the
top precisely when the
other set leaves off at
the bottom.</p>
<p>Another two-person
variation that I've come
up with (Ihaven't heard
or seen this anywhere
else), this is by far the
easiest of the hand drill
methods that I've worked.
Use a bearing block and
have one person apply
the downward pressure.
The other spins the drill
vigorously, instructing
the "bearer" how much
pressure to apply. The
spinner, not having to
apply the downward
pressure, isn't exhausted
so easily, enabling the
spark to be quickly made.
</p>
<h2>Cordage</h2>
<p>To me, any description of the use of the bow/drill that doesn't include the
making of cordage is incomplete. Such a common thing as a piece of string
just isn't always in your pockets when you may be in need of fire, especially
in a survival situation. And when you most need this fire (in winter cold and
damp), you don't really want to tear your clothing up to make a string. Even
if you did, you may not know enough about how to prepare it to keep it
from breaking under the stress you'd place on it when using the bow and drill.
Top: Hemp cordage still attached to the unprepared strip. Above: Stinging nettle
cordage. This piece "made fire" with the bow and drill.</p>
<p>This section will teach you how to make usable cordage of the kind
that's able to withstand the use of the bow and drill. I've personally used
the cordage types that I state are suitable for this. I'll also mention by name
others that I've heard or read about but not tested myself. Some readers of
this book are likely to have with them certain valuable items (handkerchief,
dog fur, human hair) in the most primitive situation, and may find others
commonly afield. For additional sources, once you've soaked up the
information contained herein, you can experiment, letting your imagination
be your limit.</p>
<h2>Making Cordage</h2>
<p>I'll attempt to describe this simple craft by words—something not so simply
done. I'll also use photos of my own, since I'm more adept at taking them
than at arranging words.</p>
<p>Let's begin. Take several strands of thread; any kind or size will work.
Let's just make them 3' long for this demonstration. Lay them out on
a flat surface and use a magic marker (or anything similar) and dye the
strands black or dark for one third of their length (that's 1', folks). You
don't have to dye them; the color is added simply to make the process
more understandable on this trial run. Pick this bunch of strands up at the
point where the dye begins. Now, you have hanging from your fingers two
lengths of strands, one being 2' long and white, the other 1' long and black.
Correct? You right-handers hold them between the thumb and forefinger
of your left hand. Let's say that the shorter black strands are now the ones
uppermost in your grip. Begin with these (my reference to these individual
strands will now be references to either the black or the white—still with
me?). Now, take these black strands and twist them tightly clockwise
(that's to your right) for 1/2" or so. Twist the now-twisted black strands
counterclockwise, over the yet-untwisted whites; hold them securely. Now,
twist the whites clockwise and twist that over the blacks counterclockwise.
You'll find yourself always working the top bundle as they switch places.
That's it—the entire secret. Just keep doing this till you're within a few
inches of the end of a strand, and splice in more, to continue for as long as
you like. Keep the splices at different intervals on
the two sections, to keep the whole stronger. Constant splicing of few fibers
makes for a stronger whole. The twisting clockwise of the individual strands
and twisting them counterclockwise into one strand is the way to do it. The
contrary twisting holds the whole damn thing together. It's a very simple
concept—till one tries to put it into words.</p>
<p>With this knowledge, your life in the wilds takes on a new dimension. You
don't have to think for very long before the possible applications start forming
in your mind. From threads to ropes, the list of uses for cordage is endless.
Cordage materials need to be strong enough for the task at hand, but
also must be pliable. Although dry grass would certainly be strong enough
for the bow or drill (as well as numerous other uses), its brittleness makes it
unusable. It would break immediately just tying a knot.<p>
<p>We'll begin with what you're likely to have with you when thrown into a
survival situation: a neckerchief or scarf, or something similar. Tear this into
strips approximately 1" wide (a normal neckerchief is about 18" square).
Pick up the first strip as with the fibers (in thirds) and begin the twisting
action as described above. When reaching the end of one strip, I tear the
last 2" into thirds (also with the new spliced-in strand) to help interlock the
splice, and on I go. When I reached 3 1/2' with the kerchief I was working,
I quit with 5 strips left over. (See bottom photo opposite.) The advantage
to being able to use this technique is that in a survival situation you might
have access to a T-shirt, or some bandages from a first aid kit. The list of
possibilities goes on.</p>
<p>If you're lucky enough to get lost with a furry critter, so much the better.
I worked with the underfur of a dog and found that I had an unlimited
supply on hand. It wasn't all that difficult to get the hang of working with
it, either, though different than the longer fibers I'm more accustomed to.
In a few hours, I ended up with a good solid rope about 3 1/2' long. When
making fire with the fur, though, I found that it stretched easily and slipped
badly on the drill, till I wetted it—then it worked like a charm. You might
also come across the carcass of a furbearer (coon, coyote, and the like)
where enough leftover fur might be lying around. (See photos on page 28.)
Something that most people will have with them is a supply of hair. If
things got tight, you could cut your own. This works well. I ended up with a
good strong rope in little time (not my own—donated by Margie's Country
Image). The hair that I worked with was about 6" to 8" long, though a bit
shorter would also work. Again, it's easier to work with if wetted first.<p>
<h2><ins>Plants for Cordage</ins></h2>
<p>The list of fibrous plants that can be used for cordage is long. I won't cover
them all, as I don't know them all. I've never worked with dogbane (also
called Indian hemp), which I've heard is about the best plant around.
Stinging nettle, velvetleaf, and hemp (marijuana) are three similar,
widely distributed, and common plants (weeds?). All make a good, strong
cordage easily capable of withstanding the stress of the bow and drill. Using
dried plants, I take a rounded rock and lightly pound them to break the
stalk, and then tear this into strips (roughly thirds). I then begin at the top of
the plant, "break" the inner material, and then "strip" the outer layer loose.<p>
<p>I follow down the plant, breaking and stripping about every inch (this works
better than just stripping the outer fibers, which will tear easily). (See photos
opposite.) I end with a rough strip, maybe 2 1/2' to 3' long. This I gently roll
between my fingers or my palms to separate the fibers and to remove the
chaff. What I end up with is suitable for cording.</p>
<p>The leaf of the yucca gives a strong fiber that's also easy to work. It
can be used either green or dried. With the yucca leaf, the fibers are inside.
Take the dried leaf and beat it gently to separate the fibers some. This helps
it to soften faster while soaking. Then soak the pounded leaves till supple.
When your yucca is partly or fully green, take a rounded knife blade (flint
or otherwise) and scrape the outer covering from both sides (the soaking
makes this easier with dried leaves). Then work the fibers loose by rubbing
back and forth with your fingers. Superb cordage material.</p>
<p>You can come up with additional usable fibers with only a little
experimenting. When in the timber or fields, just grab different weeds
and grasses as you go along, break them, and try to separate the fibers.
If they hang together in strips, try using them. Grass will work and can
be fashioned into a great rough cordage suitable for baskets, mats, or
insulating liners to winter camps.</p>
<p>While on the subject of plants, let's not forget tree barks. The inner
barks of many are fibrous and work superbly, as with the fibrous plants.
Cedar makes a fast though weak cord. Look around a bit in your area to
find what's available. Not often thought of, the inner or outer nonfibrous
barks of most trees will work well also, especially for the emergency bow or
drill. What I used in my test was the inner bark of the Osage orange (I was
debarking bowstaves). First removing the rough outer bark, I then carefully
withdrew thin strips of the next layer. The average length I ended up with
was about 3', a super-good length. I cut these down to about 1/4" widths
and shaved them till about 1/16" thick. This individual strip I then used
as I would a bunch of strands, twisting away. When I reached the end of a
strip, I cut about 2 1/2" of the ends to splice into my many thin threads, and
continued on. This made one of the best quickie bow or drill strings that
I've worked with (besides maybe rawhide). Once dried, it wasn't worth a
damn—too stiff and brittle, plus you can't cord it when dry. But when wet
(green), superb! Caution: When using the bark from any live tree, though,
do so only in an emergency, as it damages the tree (and could even kill it).
If it's necessary to use a live tree, take individual strips of bark from several.
This helps to ensure the life of the tree. It also would be better for the tree if
you stripped the bark from the branches.</p>

<h2><ins>Animal Material for Cordage</ins></h2>
<p>Now, let's discuss some animal material. Sinew (tendons) supply some of
the strongest cordage available. An animal is loaded with sinew in various
lengths. The longest and the easiest to work with are the long strips running
down either side of the backbone (silver colored, lying on top of the meat,
running from under the shoulder to the hip). Sinew is most easily removed
with a dull knife, to prevent accidentally cutting it. Scrape it clean and then
lay it out flat to dry. It works easiest if dried first, then broken and separated
into threads of the appropriate size, and finally wetted again before
cording. The resulting strong cordage was the most common of the Indian
bowstrings. The shorter tendons of the legs are also usable, only not as easily
since they're shorter and thicker, which makes them harder to separate and
work with.</p>
<h2><ins>Rawhide for Cordage</ins></h2>
<p>Rawhide is another good cordage material. It's best used after it's dried,
primarily because drying eliminates stretching (note that I'm still talking
string for the bow or drill!). With rawhide, I don't actually "cord" it. Instead,
I double it and twist it up fairly tight, stretching it and tying it off at both
ends to dry. I find that the doubling, twisting, and stretching eliminate the
stretching while in use (I use this for bowstrings); add strength; and also
help the rawhide to grip the drill better. I cut the deer rawhide 1/4" wide, a
width that seems to be plenty strong enough. I've shot up to several dozen
arrows through 55- to 60-pound bows that I've made, and have yet to have
one rawhide string break.</p>
<p>But enough about cordage. You've now got sufficient information to go
out, identify certain usable plants and other materials, work with them, and
put them to your use. You also have learned enough to be able to search out
and experiment, to come up with many more. This is not an exact science. Just
bear in mind the important rules of length and pliability of the material used.<p>
<h2><ins>A Coupla Fire-Making Tips</ins></h2>

<p>Kennie Sherron of Ponca City, Oklahoma, sent me the following two firemaking
ideas.</p>
<p>A fire drill, as Kennie describes it, for the Indian who has it all. Made from
deer leg bone, it's squarish and will never "round." The bone being hollow, it's
reinforced at both ends to prevent splitting (here with rawhide). The piece shown
above at left is permanent, to fit into the bearing block. The lower piece, pulled
out here, is a replaceable soft tip. When I first got this in the mail, I just kinda
put it aside, but carried it along for show-and-tell. Well, at one set of demos we
actually ran out of usable drills near the end of the second day, after more than a
hundred-plus fires. But we did have some short pieces of yucca, and so gave this
a try. I knew that it would work but was unprepared for how well it worked. The
squarish bone spins like a champ in the bow, and the extra weight of the overall
drill gave me much better control. And, most importantly, we now had enough
fire drill tips for several hundred more fires. I like it!</p>
<p>Another, probably more important, tip for a fire-maker lacking a helper: this one
for the hand drill, whose use, even under the best circumstances, is never easy.
It's a piece of cordage (or, as illustrated here, a strip of brain-tanned buckskin)
with slits cut for the thumbs, tied to the upper end of the drill (and also tied over
it, in most cases). The thumbs placed in the slits provide constant downward
pressure, letting you constantly spin the drill. Makes starting a fire almost easy,
and greatly increased my successes.</p>

<h2><ins>Primitive Tools</ins></h2>
<h3>Making and Using Them</h3>
<p>For the most part, we will be using modern tools to show
you how to maintain life in a survival or wilderness situation. But, you
might ask, "What's the purpose of learning a complete series of primitive
wilderness living skills if I have to resort to modern technology to
accomplish them?"</p>
<p>Great question. We feel that the best way is to learn the skills
themselves, then learn how to do them the hard way, this time using
primitive tools and implements.</p>
<p>Hard way? As you'll see in this chapter, "hard" is the wrong term.
"Different" is a better word. Different and more time-consuming. But in
adapting primitive to our modern lifestyles, aren't we trying to get away a
little from the time-consuming, overly complicated, highly mechanized, and
artificially powered tasks of ordinary life?<p>
<p>Of course, you can read up on any of these subjects in a variety of
reference books, and watch all kinds of demonstrations that you may find
on the Internet. But if you don't just jump right in there and apply yourself,
nothing's gonna happen.</p>
<p>Learning to make and use primitive tools in a day-to-day situation
really isn't hard. Still, we feel that if you're trying to learn to master tool
making while at the same time changing your accepted approach to using
such tools, you'll be spending a lot of extra time and encountering much
frustration. Therefore, we teach the skills first, and then we teach how to
accomplish them with primitive tools. As you'll see, eventually it all
naturally ties together.</p>
<p>But what do we mean by "tools"? Our hands are tools, aren't they?
I suppose that, for our definition, here we'll be making tools for our hands
to use to do the projects that we'll be covering. That will pretty much
encompass any project that you're likely to happen upon in a primitive
situation. There are three important points about tools:
<p>1 Tools need to be made from materials that can be found in nature:
stone, shell, bone, antler, horn, wood, and so forth.</p>
<p>2 Just what do we need these tools to do? Gouge or poke, chop, pound,
bash, split, and (most important) cut. Put yourself in a primitive
situation without a cutting implement of some sort, and you won't do
very well.</p>
<p>3 Methods of manufacture include flintknap, peck, grind, and burn.
Now I'll try to break this down into some semblance of order.
First and most importantly, you need some type of cutting tool—a
pocket knife, so to speak. Think about all the projects that you do, or would
like to do, or might have to do, in your daily regime in the wilds, and what
tool will be the most important? A cutting tool. Let's begin with that.</p>
<h2></ins>Basic Flintknapping</h2></ins>
<p>A lot has been taught, and some little written, about flintknapping,
which is the art of systematically turning stone, particularly flint, into
functional tools. ("Knap" simply means to break with a quick blow.) Some
of what we've seen in print is good, a little of what we've read is very good,
but most is just trash. Almost nothing generally available to the student of
primitive wilderness skills attends to the very basics, the most important
aspect of knapping: that is, the obtaining of the spall or flake either to be
used as is for the tool or to be turned into a tool. This first basic function
of spalling, called making the flake, is the most important part of knapping.
Without it you can travel no further. With it, there's nothing more you need
to know.</p>
<p>Most certainly we've had help from others in learning what knapping
we know, but we've found that even the most willing of teachers weren't
answering the questions that we didn't even know we needed to ask. All
who knap certainly possess some grasp of what the principles are but they</p>
<p>(1) weren't conscious of what they were doing (it just came naturally, and it
worked), or</p><p>(2) they didn't know how to present what they were doing, or
</p><p>(3) they had advanced so far that they had forgotten the importance of
the basics.<p>
<p>A good many modern flintknappers have learned their skills backward,
doing the last step first. I know that I did. Here we start at the beginning,
Left: Fancy blades, yes. But in our actual primitive workings they account for
probably less than 5 percent of the actual workload. Right: These easily made
flakes do the majority.</p>
<h2><ins>Safety</ins></h2>
<p>Please take care to follow these safety precautions when
doing any sort of flintknapping. You have only two eyes, and
one pair of lungs, and the normal set of limbs—and you'll
want to protect all of them.</p>
<p>(1) Wear eye protection when working stone. It doesn't take but one
misdirected sharp edge to eliminate sight.</p>
<p>(2) Don't breathe the dust. Every time that you remove a flake from the
stone, you'll create dust. Once in the lungs, it cuts and creates scar
tissue that will be there forever. It doesn't go away, like when you quit
smoking. Those tiny razor blades do some serious cutting. And the
resulting scar tissue will eventually kill you if you breathe enough of
the dust over a long enough time (think "silicosis"). Be aware that
the dust not only is in the air, but also gets into your clothing and
whatever. Best not to do your flaking in the house but instead do it
outside, letting the wind clear the air for you. Most dust masks won't
work; some will help a bit (something is better than nothing).</p>
<p>(3) You're going to cut yourself, so keep a supply of bandages handy.
If you wish, wear gloves or use a piece of leather while holding the stone
you're working with. We don't do this anymore, but we occasionally
still cut ourselves. Also, be cautious of where the falling flake will
land. I've more than once driven a flake into my leg. Be cautious and
you'll be all right.</p>
<p>(4) Don't flintknap (especially the advanced blades) in the company of
those with sensitive ears. The accompanying language is similar to
that of auto mechanics.</p>
<h2><ins>Flint</ins></h2>
<p>Just what is flint? Well, according to the dictionary, flint is a form of
quartzite. The description of quartzite is a bit more complicated, so I'll
simplify. I'll lump all the stone that we'll work "flint like" into one category
and call it flint. As far as I know, there are only two sources of true flint in
the United States: Georgetown flint, from Texas; and White River flint, from
South Dakota. The rest are cherts, jaspers, chalcedonies, agates, and plain
old quartz. To my way of thinking (here goes my theorizing again!), most
all of these are just various stages of development or quality of quartzite (as
coal is to diamonds). Quartzite cobbles are pretty common, nearly as close
as your local streambed or road cut. Generally, the better-quality flints are
smooth and have a sheen. The poorer ones are more grainy (as in sandy).
Most have an outer coating, sort of like a limestone covering, called the
cortex ("cortex" is the commonly used term, though "corticose" is the more
proper). Cortexes vary in workability. Some can be left on and used with the
tool, but others are too crumbly and won't do the job at hand. The cortex
can hide the flint underneath, so you'll need to do some experimenting to
find out just what's what (applying the rules that follow).</p>
<p>First, cobble of Dover chert from Tennessee; light brown inside,
dark brown cortex. Next, cobble of chert from flint hills of Kansas; white
limestone cortex, dark blue banded ring of high-quality chert with lighter
colored interior of lesser quality. Third, lens of knife river flint (chalcedony) from
North Dakota, rootbeer colored and translucent; white, hard, smooth cortex.
Many of you are familiar with obsidian that's used in the making of
"arrowheads" and other tools. Obsidian is also workable under the same
rules that follow. It's simply natural glass made by volcanic action. Obsidian
is the easiest of these materials to work, it gives the sharpest edge known
to us humans, and it's great for beginners and advanced knappers alike.
Its drawbacks? It's quite brittle and extremely dangerous (thousands of tiny
dust razor blades to be breathed into your lungs or stuck into your various
body parts). Many flintknappers who haven't worked obsidian kinda knock
those who do work with it because of its ease of workability, but most of
those knocking it wouldn't be able to turn out a fine, thin, long blade
from obsidian without breaking it first. In this book we'll call it all "flint"
and ignore the obsidian, though the principles are the same.</p>
<p>One quality that all these rocks possess is that they're homogeneous (of
the same composition throughout). Simply put, they're all one, there's no
grain to them (unlike the grain in wood), and energy will travel equally in
any direction that it's directed.</p>
<h2><ins>Techniques of Working Flint</ins></h2>
<p>You can predictably remove flakes from a stone in three generally accepted
ways. All three have similar, but different, rules:</p>
<p>(1) Indirect percussion, where you place a blunt pointed tool (such as an
antler tine) at the point of removal of flake from the parent rock, then
strike this with a billet.</p>
<p>(2) Pressure flaking, when you place the antler (or wood tool) against the
parent piece and remove a flake by applying pressure.</p>
<p>Here we'll work primarily with the basic direct percussion method, just
touching on pressure flaking as a means of resharpening. Pressure flaking
can also come in handy in platform preparation.<p>
<p>With direct percussion what we're doing is striking one rock with
another (wood, antler, and bone are some other tools that can be used).
Now, for our purposes, almost any rock will suffice as a hammerstone, even
the same as the core, but this isn't recommended. The better case is to use a
sand-type stone, but not some crumbly old piece. It should grip the platform
(defined below) for just a microsecond to allow the energy to be released
smoothly and yet be strong enough to take the abuse. The hammerstone
deforms as the core bites into it. The harder the flint, the harder should be
the hammerstone.</p>
<p>To remove large flakes from a large nodule, you'll need a large
hammerstone. I prefer to work with a fist-sized and smaller hammerstone
for my general work, as this fits comfortably in my hand and seems easier
for me. The smaller the hammerstone, the more force necessary for flake
removal; and the more force exerted, the less the accuracy. And accuracy is
important. You'll discover that if the rock is properly struck, the flake will
separate easily.</p>
<h2><ins>Rules</ins></h2>
<p>To make finely flaked, long, thin blades, you first must learn many, many
rules and have (usually) years of experience. In order for you to make the
stone tool necessary to perform the functions outlined earlier, you need
to know only two rules. With them, you can be turning out tools (flakes)
almost immediately. This has been argued by one of the country's foremost
knappers, but I have proved him wrong many times. In fact, after one session
I conducted of 45 minutes or so, 3 of the 15 students present were doing just
that—and they were on average 11 years old! The rest didn't seem to care.</p>
<p>Two rules. Pay attention, now. Your practice will be your finished tool.
Two rules (I repeat myself purposely), one more important than the other:
(1) the cone (angle), and (2) the platform.</p><p>The cone is the more important.
The cone determines how rock will break when struck. Flint breaks
conchoidally. The instant that a force strikes the surface of the flint, the
energy is transmitted into a cone radiating at about 120°. The break in the
stone pretty much follows this cone. The significance of the cone is that
it determines at what angle and where you must strike a blow in order to
remove a particular chunk of stone.</p>
<p>The platform is the
surface that the blow is
delivered to. It must have
a particular shape, or the
blow will be ineffective.
The platform can't be
crumbly or fragile. If it is,
the stone will crumble when
struck, rather than fracture
cleanly. The platform is the
edge of the stone forming an angle of less than 90°. The importance of the
platform is that it determines whether or not a blow will produce a flake
at all. You can beat all day on an obtuse angle (more than 90°) and not
produce a predictable flake, or you can strike a weak platform and ruin it.</p>
<p>You can know only the concept of the cone and produce tools, or you
can know only the platform and not produce any. Know and be proficient
with both, and you'll be a beginning flintknapper. You'll be able to remove
flakes from a stone in a predictable manner. Conversely, you'll be able to
predict what's left behind after your work is done. You'll be in control.
Each time you remove a flake, you need to prepare a new platform for
the removal of another flake from the same area. At each stage, before a
blow is struck, you need to study the rock and ask yourself what must be the
angle of the blow to the core to remove a targeted flake, and then you must
ensure yourself of a good, solid striking surface (platform).</p>
<p>The cone—the all-important cone. All knappers are well aware that it's
a physical law that you can't flintknap without some knowledge of the cone.
There are literally hundreds of rules that must be followed in the course of
advanced flintknapping (not covered here), but you'll find that a
good share of them are dictated because of the cone.</p>
</p>Remember, the line of force isn't a straight cleavage, like splitting a
block of wood with an ax; rather, it's a circular cone (note photos). This
line of force, as it were, I can't stress to you enough. Once you become
aware of what it is that I'm saying, a little light in your head will flash a
"Bingo!" sign and you'll find yourself with a damn good comprehension
of what's happening. Like most other primitive skills, there's no magical
formula—just regular laws of physics that, once understood (along with lots
of practice), will enable you to be in charge.</p>

Support
We've established that when you strike a rock, the energy is transmitted
conchoidally—into a cone. Still, there are some variances. If you were to
strike a blade from an end of a long, slender piece, shock waves from the
blow travel through the rock haphazardly. If the rock weren't supported
properly, these haphazard shock waves may snap the piece in two at the
unsupported end. So be aware of this for some of your basic work.
(Note photos.)
Three common ways to support a
piece. Above: First, here the hand's
doing the supporting, though this
particular piece is almost too long
for free hand support. The far end
is held against the palm while the
fingers hold the worked end.
Right, top: Second, lay the piece
on your thigh (in this case without
a pad, as would be the case in
the field). Most knappers use a
thick leather pad. In this photo the
worked end alone is resting on the
thigh while the other end is simply
"supported"by the knapper's
other hand. The entire piece could
be resting on the thigh.
Right, bottom: Third, in this case,
the worked end is free while the
other end's supported by being
pushed tightly into the thigh.
Chapter 2: Primitive Tools — Making and Using Them 49
Discoidal
When working with oval, flattish quartzite cobbles, you'll sometimes
find it easiest to "get into" the rock or to simply remove a blade using a
method taught by Boulder Outdoor Survival School and given the coinage
"discoidal." In this operation, a cobble (ideally about 6" long, 4" wide, and
2" deep) is swung onto an anvil stone (something substantially larger and
harder) and strikes near the end of the cobble. This will remove a roundish
sharp flake. This is the same concept that I've already discussed, only in
reverse, with all angles the same. By using the space left from the flake
removed as a platform, you can then remove another flake from the reverse
side by conventional percussion, and then another, giving you a useful
handax—one of humankind's oldest stone tools.
With the discoidal technique, the flake is removed by the same rules, only the
hammerstone here is the anvil. Two tools: the flake and the core. Using the
platform formed with the flake removal, a handax is readily created by simply
removing more flakes (knives).
50 Ultimate Guide to Wilderness Living
Bipolar
The term "bipolar" here doesn't mean what you think it does. When smaller
cobbles similar to those described above are the only stone available, you're
still not without a knife. By taking the flattest of these and placing it upended
on an anvil rock, you can split these neatly in two by striking a blow
on the top. What this does is drive the energy directly through the stone to
the anvil and then back up. Some stones are definitely harder than others, so
several blows may be indicated.
Watch those fingers—it's easy to smash them. And wear
protective eye gear (or close your eyes just before you strike).
With normal percussion flake removal, an angle of less than 90° is
necessary (as noted earlier). What, then, to do if all you have are egg-shaped
rocks? One answer is to simply throw one against another and hope for the
best. But to do it like the "big boys," and retain some control, we can turn
to bipolar here, also. My limited experience with this, using larger pieces
(mostly obsidian), has shown that, despite drawings showing the contrary,
an egg-shaped rock that's hit in a bipolar fashion on an anvil rock doesn't
always neatly split in two. So direct your blow carefully, and be certain to
close your eyes just before contact (even with eye protection). Pieces of
sharp stone can, and will, be flying all over the place. You will end up with
basically two halves, giving you the beginning of a core for flake removal.
Splitting a small cobble in two with bipolar can
be tough on fingers but does work.
Chapter 2: Primitive Tools — Making and Using Them 51
Some Notes
# It's difficult to remove long flakes from a flat surface (because the energy
is cone shaped and tends also to curve outward and into the stone).
# Flakes will tend to follow ridge lines (certainly, as there's no mass on
either side to prohibit the cone from releasing).
^ It's difficult, maybe impossible, to shoot flakes through a valley. The
energy will stop at the far side of the first ridge and probably "hinge"
(create an abrupt line of stoppage). It's almost as hard to run a flake
through a "hill" (over 90°).
# A good practice is to draw the projected flake to be removed on
the stone with chalk, and then carefully study the results. This will
eliminate haphazard banging (tip from Scott Silsby).
# The ideal flake can be removed from a surface that's off a platform
of less than 90° (at and above 90°, the energy is shot too deeply into
the "mass" of the stone). The outer surface runs smoothly, with no
abrupt "hills" or "valleys" to impede the energy flow, and the surface
is somewhat rounded (as with a ball).

Once you have the understanding of the concepts placed forth here, you
might want to advance even further. The only complete book that I'm aware
of that's worth its salt is The Art of Flintknapping by D. C. Waldorf. Its
only drawback (that I know of) is that it doesn't begin with the basics—a
good reason for my own book! The first time or two that I went through
it, I was ready to trash it. I simply wasn't able to comprehend what it was
that the author was saying. It was too advanced. But, once I got some basic
understanding under my belt, I took in more and more of its principles. I
still read it occasionally and each time pick up more. Get it.
Another primer on this subject is Flintknapping—The Art of Making
Stone Tools, by Paul Hellweg. Online sources can help you find used copies
of many useful books on the topic.
Whew!
I'm sure glad that's over with! Not that the subject of flintknapping is so
difficult, as you've no doubt seen. What's difficult is finding the right words
and putting them with the right photos to make it all gel.
Let's proceed now to discuss other materials we can use for tools when
caught in a survival or wilderness situation.
Trying to figure some sequence for what follows has been about as timeconsuming
as doing it. You'll find that much of what I'm laying out from
here on to the end of this chapter ties back to the basic principles of stone
working (knapping). You'll also discover that working with one resource
requires, on occasion, working with another. It's that old circle of primitive
technology that kept so many of our ancient ancestors alive and kicking
(thanks, Great-great-great...grandpa!).
What I've done now is kinda laid out the photos that Geri and I have
created for this chapter. I'll write around them, since they speak much better
than any words or drawings of mine could. Since we've been concentrating
on sharp edges, let's continue along those lines.
Shell
Whether thick ones or thin ones, shells can be used in many ways as tools.
Heavier ones can actually take quite a bit of abuse as choppers or scrapers,
though probably the most common use would be as a cutter of some sort.
Chapter 2: Primitive Tools — Making and Using Them 53
Ultimate Guide to Wilderness Living
Sandstone
Various grits
and harnesses of
sandstone are very
important tools in the
production of tools.
Heavy Blunt Instruments
Simple tools such as heavy blunt instruments have lots of uses, from driving
stakes to mashing nuts. Of course, the easiest way to use a tool is to simply
grab the nearest rock or piece of wood and bash away. On the following
pages we'll refine this quite a bit.
Wood

Chopping (left) with handax of tough quartzite, this hard piece of Osage orange
took less than 10 minutes to score deep enough to break (right) where we
wanted it to. Finished club (center) has had the hand grip chopped to a size
more suitable for our hands.
Chapter 2: Primitive Tools — Making and Using Them 55
Stone
Rocks can, of course, be used as is. You can also shape them to about any
shape you wish, by pecking (continual hitting with a harder rock). Not
difficult, just time-consuming. This illustrates the pecking of a groove into a
very hard piece of rock, using an even harder piece of jasper. Holding
the piece in your hand or on your leg is recommended, as the pecked rock
may break in two if placed onto a hard surface. (Hafting will be illustrated
further along.)
Bone and Antler
Antler and especially bone are common finds of any gatherer. All animals die
and, unlike humans, their remains are allowed to renourish the Earth from
whence they came. If you can come upon them before they disintegrate,
these can be dandy additions to any tool kit.
Knives, projectile points, wedges, scrapers, needles, fishhooks, and awls
are just a few of the many uses of these items.
The most common and easiest way to downsize bone and antler
into workable sizes for most tools is simply to bash them with a blunt
instrument, though this certainly isn't the most reliable method. If time
and patience permit, scoring (cutting a line into the bone along which you
desire the break to occur) beforehand can bend the odds in your favor as
to which direction the break may happen. The deeper the score, the better.
Some real fine, long awls and needles have come from leg bones that had
been properly scored lengthwise. Moist heat will temporarily soften them,
making scoring and cutting much easier. With antler, however, overboiling
will weaken it considerably. Scraping with a stone blade and rubbing on
sandstone will add the finishing touches. In fact, a piece of sandstone is
often the only tool necessary to finish out a piece.
56 Ultimate Guide to Wilderness Living
Bone
Using a rock as our basher (upper left), we reduced this deer leg bone to more
manageable pieces (upper right). Some grinding on sandstone (lower left)
gave us a nice awl, projectile point or knife, and a fishhook (lower right). Simple
bashing and grinding produced these tools in mere minutes.
Antler
Similar to bone, in characteristics and workability, is antler. Through our
own personal experiences, we've found that antler is more flexible than bone
and so will take a bit more abuse. Also, it seems that the molecular structure
of antler is tighter than that of bone, allowing us to get sharper cutting edges.
Horn, no examples of which are shown here, seems to be even more flexible
and tighter in molecular structure. (We define antler as the outer projection
growing from the heads of certain animals such as elk and deer, and horn as
the outer sheathing of antler on such animals as cow, buffalo, and sheep.)
Shown here are several examples of things to make from antler.

Digging Stick
One of humankind's oldest tools is the digging stick—simply a pointed stick that
is used for digging or prying. It, of course, requires the use of tools in making.
.. .fire hardens the end by driving out
moisture and also makes it easier to point...
Chapter 2: Primitive Tools — Making and Using Them 59
Result: A very functional, durable, hard-pointed digging stick.
Wooden Awl
While we're still working with wood, let's do another quickie project, again
using tools to make another tool.
Using our trusty
quartzite handax and
wooden maul (left),
we split the leftover
end of our digging stick
(right).
60 Ultimate Guide to Wilderness Living
Then we chop it to shape with a flint ax (below left), shave it further with the
sharp flint, and finally (below right) grind it on sandstone to end with (bottom)
a finished awl or possible needle using the natural knothole.
Celt
In previous pages you've seen the making and using of choppers made from
quartzite and flint. Here I'll show another common approach to the making
of an ax—the celt (pronounced selt, and related to prehistoric stone or
metal implements shaped like an ax head). Made from what most refer to as
greenstone (green is its more common color in certain areas), the stone is
actually a mixture of minerals (basalt, jade, and hematite are some common
celt materials, though each locale has its own). It can be found almost
anywhere, located often as cobbles, but also may be found in veins.
The property that we're looking for is a certain degree of hardness
and smoothness so that the piece will grind down to a sharp edge but will
also take abuse. We want a hard, dense, tough rock. Several types break
conchoidally, which in many cases (such as here) helps in reduction. One
test is to remove a flake, grind and polish it, and then attempt to break it
with your hands. Some of these stones won't flake, in which case pecking
with another, harder rock may be in order.
The celt illustrated on the next page took fully eight hours to make.
We've found that knapped flint axes take minutes to make (versus hours
for ground axes), and sharpen themselves as the edge chips (as opposed to
weakening and dulling for the ground), thereby leaving us to maintain that
the flake flint ax is economically better.
Chapter 2: Primitive Tools — Making and Using Them 61
Breaking in two (left) a large lens of "greenstone" by laying it at the edge of a
rock and placing a well-struck (and lucky!) blow using a hammerstone. Then
reducing it by percussion (right) to a more manageable size.
When presented with certain high areas, pecking (left) can be the solution
to more quickly removing material. Most time will be spent in grinding and
polishing (right) on various surfaces of sandstone.
Finished celt has (left) flattish top to help prevent splitting of handle, tapering
toward the rear (middle) so as to fit into hole in handle, and a proper angle at
the cutting edge (right). Too thin an angle will break too easily, too abrupt an
angle won't cut as well.
62 Ultimate Guide to Wilderness Living
Hafting
The placing of an ax, celt, or other tool onto a handle can really make your
work easier. It's not all that difficult to do, once you've become familiar with
working with the various natural materials. Since we just made a celt, let's
now haft it.
Top left: The roughed-out handle after being reduced by fire and chopping;
(right) beginning to burn hole by placing a coal and blowing through tube;
(left) directing the burning by blowing onto firebrand. Burning the hole can be
tricky. Once the area is charred, it will ignite and burn readily. To prevent burning
where you don't want it, remove the char. The hardwood won't ignite as easily. You
can also place water or a slurry of clay in areas you don't want to burn. When the
hole becomes deep enough, the fire starves for oxygen and
you need to blow constantly. You can burn from the opposite direction after
reaching halfway.
Chapter 2: Primitive Tools — Making and Using Them 63
Sizing of the celt to the hole is critical. Contacts at the top and bottom must be
spread evenly the entire thickness, with the surfaces laid flat to help prevent
splitting out of the handle. I like to include a "Y"at the top of the handle, as I find
this stronger; leave about 2" at the top. Some woods split easier than others, so
it's wise to check this out before you get 4 to 6 hours invested into making the
handle (this handle took 4-plus hours to make). Elm, yes—cedar, no. The weight
of the wood is rather important, also, as heavier wood makes for less work when
chopping. The hole is tapered, as is the celt, so that friction from use seats it tight.
A gap of at least 1/16" needs to be left at the sides, otherwise the celt will spread
the handle out and split it. (Special thanks here to Scott Silsby for his efforts in
helping me try to explain the qualities of "greenstone," a not-so-easy task.)
On smaller grooved hammers or axes (two left photos), we've wrapped the
handle itself around the stone, twice on the left one and once on the right one.
Most green saplings or limbs are very flexible and are made even more so
by boiling or heating for a short period. They've then been held in place with
natural fiber cordage, the one on the right permanently to be used as is and
the one on the left to be reinforced with a light rawhide wrapping sewn on with
sinew (as in two right photos).

To mount a blade on a stick, you can saw into the end with a flake: the
most time-consuming. Or simply split the piece in two, carve out a channel
for the blade, and then bind it all together, gluing it if you have something.
The easiest that we know of is this trick discovered by Larry Dean Olsen.
Pay special attention to this group of photos.
Right photo group, top to
bottom: (1) Blade is laid
alongside shaft and notches
are cut (A) leaving behind
the size you want the groove
to be. A thin line is cut (B)
where split is to stop (depth

carefully split on both sides
to line (B). (3) Shaft is turned
and the groove is "popped"
out by bending in both
directions from line (B). Pay
special attention to where
the fingers and thumbs are
placed for pressure points.
If you're not careful, the
shaft will simply break at its
weakest point, the notches.
(4) The results.
Right photo group: Once
groove is made, it's
best to custom fit the
piece, especially stone.
Remember, few straight

trimming with a sharp
blade, the piece is made
to fit better (middle). The
resulting knife or scraper
(right), lashed into place

may not be the strongest
but will still do a number of
chores. Lashing with sinew
and setting the piece with
pitch or hide glue would
make it extremely durable.
Chapter 2: Primitive Tools — Making and Using Them 65
Adze
The adze is a specialized tool used for trimming and shaping wood. The
blade itself can be made from "greenstone" and ground or flaked from flint,
as done here. It's mounted opposite from an ax, at right angles to the handle.
Unlike the ax, the blade will be flatter on one side than the other, allowing
more careful removal of wood.
Left: The blade sits on a solid platform of the handle, and it can break off. I'm
repairing just that by having glued the separated platform back on and lashing
it in place, then drilling a hole with a hand drill mounted with a stone point and
plugging the hole with a carved piece of hardwood glued in place.
Right top: Another method of attaching the blade is to wrap it in rawhide or
buckskin for cushion and tying that to a flat-ended handle. This works well by
absorbing a lot of the shock.
Right middle: Drilled hole.
Right bottom: The finished repair job, and it has done a lot of work since.

Working with the Tools
To this point in the chapter, we've dwelt primarily with the making of tools,
though many also used some previously made ones. Now we're going to do
a coupla projects that are aimed only at using your tools in a wilderness or
survival situation.
One project that covers most primitive tool usages is the bow (detailed
in full in Chapter 4), so we'll head to the timber in a bit and show you how
to do this with tools we've made up till now.
When working with students we stress the importance of being capable
of heading into the wilds and making a fire (Chapter 1) with nothing but
what's available. This is what I'll cover first.

Chaptei 2: Primitive Tools — Making and Using Them 69

Up till now we've worked with green wood. To cure it out, we now tie it (top) in
whatever position we desire the final bow to take. (This "quickie" bow procedure
we learned from our good friend Jim Riggs of Oregon.) Let it dry from several
days to more than a week, depending on the wood (the denser the wood, the
longer). In this case, we let this piece of eastern red cedar (actually, a juniper)
dry for one week in our hot basement. At this point (left, middle), the roughedout
bow is just that: rough. But with some little scraping (left, bottom), some
careful cutting (here of the grip), and (right) sanding with stone, we end up with
(below) a pretty much finished-out piece, surrounded by some of the flake tools
used.
Chapter 2: Primitive Tools — Making and Using Them 71
There are any number of positions for you to experiment working in. Here Geri
buries one end of the bow (upper left) into her belly and the other into a secure
area in a rock and draws the flake toward her to remove wood shavings in a
hurry. She then (upper right) uses adze to make final cut to length and (bottom
left) shapes up end with a sharp flake before (bottom right) cutting notches.
Below: The finished bow. (For more detailed instructions on the making of bows,
see Chapter 4.)
Finis
So there you have it. You'll note that, in the section on flintknapping, there
was little to no mention of arrowheads or other projectile points. Well,
there's a reason for this, which I hope you've picked up on by now. They
simply aren't that important in primitive living. A sharpened stick will
kill just as certainly as any "arrowhead," if properly placed. In any case, the
making of projectile points is a schooling of its own, usually requiring years.
72 Ultimate Guide to Wilderness Living
The tools that we stress as important require no more time than it took you
to read this book and to have a little sit-down to apply.
With the exception of only a few items interspersed, everything shown
in this chapter was made for the production of this book. The celt and
handle required over 12 hours total. The bow took one afternoon to cut
and prepare to tying down, and an additional better part of a day to finish
out. The majority of the rest were made in one afternoon. This ain't to brag,
just to reinforce to you that this really isn't all that difficult. If we can do it,
anyone can.
I'll finish out this chapter by showing you a few other objects that we've
made using the techniques shown in this book.
Some things often forgotten, when speaking of tools, are food
preparation items. Both the mano-and-metate and the mortar-and-pestle are
more than a little useful when living primitively, in terms of grinding staple
items such as seeds, acorns, and corn.
Wooden Bowl
This bowl was made from a piece of aspen, following guidelines set forth in this
book and using stone tools and friction-made fires. (See Chapter 8 for further
Mano and IYIetate
Geri and I made this small metate and
the accompanying mano of pumice
(or perhaps basalt?) for use in our small
camps and demonstrations. The two
items are used as a pair for grinding
corn, grinding acorns into flour, and so
on. The depression was created simply
by grinding with the mano.

Chapter 3
Primitive,
Semipermanent Shelters
Some of my fondest memories are of sitting in a shelter tucked under pine
trees or in a forest of oaks and other hardwoods, with the wind howling, a
freezing rain or snow outside, and inside a blazing fire and a warm drink.
We've seen and heard much on shelters from other experts with outdoor
backgrounds. When people learned that we were working on a book on
shelters, almost to a person they urged us to include the basic shelter: the
debris type. This is little more than a glorified pile of leaves, grass, and sticks
that you can crawl into, much like a sleeping bag, to get out of the cold and
wet. It insulates you from whatever you want to be insulated from. It does it
well. But in this chapter we'll do little more than touch on it.
When Geri and I were kids, it was only natural to build a shelter of this
type, as it didn't take much imagination or skill. Yet I can think of three
instances of where this shelter comes in handy: a true survival situation
when you won't have time to complete a better shelter, including making
a fire; in a situation where the instructor doesn't want to take the time and
effort to show the student better housing; and finally, where the instructor
doesn't know anything more.
A debris shelter has lots of problems. If weather is bad (reason for the
shelter), you're locked into your bed till it changes. If you venture out, you'll
end up wet—something you don't want when you're trying to stay warm.
Chapter 3: Primitive, Semipermanent Shelters 75
So in a true survival situation, you're pretty well stuck looking at leaves
and grasses at nose length and lying around waiting to get found (you're
also insulated from sound and well-camouflaged). If, like the vast majority
of modern woodspeople, you've placed yourself into this woods situation,
when you finally get bored, you get up and go home.
I've been accused, most of my life, of being somewhat crazy for
spending so much time outdoors in rain and snow. But when I venture into
the elements, I try to be comfortable. I've spent the vast majority of my life
"camping out" during the winter months, both as I was growing up in the
mountainous southern tier of New York State and also for the last 40-plus
years in Kansas. Winters get cold. Some of my friends may have thought
that when I ventured out I kinda curled up in a convenient snowbank and
had beavers offer me their waterproof coats. Well, I love winters and cold
weather, but I hate being cold and miserable. A good shelter makes for good
comfortable living out of doors.
If you find yourself without bedding, the debris shelter is your bedding.
But don't make it your house, too. Build something to live in while you're
up and about and can tend a fire. Use the litter for a sleeping bag.
Once you understand fairly well the basics of a shelter—what it's
supposed to do, what its limitations are—then it'll be pretty simple to adapt
the resources you have at hand and make a comfortable camp.
A special thanks to our friend Bill Lansdown of Alva, Oklahoma, who
spent nine days with us while we constructed the shelters illustrated here.
His strong back and ready wit were a tremendous help.
What a Shelter Keeps Out (and In)
A shelter is simply a barrier between you and whatever is out there. Wind,
sun, heat, cold, rain, snow, bears...bears? No bears here. Let's stick to the
weather—the elements.
From the above list, what we'll concern ourselves with here is
protection from cold and wet. If you can get those under control, making
barriers from the other elements (excepting maybe high winds) will be a
piece of cake.
We need to keep the water out, and we also want to be able to have a
fire in, or convenient to, the house—preferably inside. We'll be using strictly
natural materials.
76 Ultimate Guide to Wilderness Living
Although these "ideal" shelters will be constructed with
the function of being able to have an inside fire, you
must at every moment be aware of the real danger of
uncontrolled lire. Remember always (and I'll remind you)
that we're actually constructing an ideal tinder nest that
can go up in flames in only seconds. Real care must be
constantly taken with fire in shelters.
Shelter Basics
Six basic elements will pretty well cover any of our shelters: site, floor, walls,
roof, smoke hole, and entrance. Let's discuss them one at a time.
Site
The location of our house should be the first thing to think about. What do
we want it near to? And what do we want it away from?
Near to trees, bushes, rocks, whatever, to help add additional shelter to
our shelter. Near to work sites. Near to water (but not in an area that might
be prone to flooding if the water level rises). Near to building materials.
Away from tall trees or other high landmarks that may draw lightning.
Away from unwanted sounds (like waterfalls) and sights. Away from any
objects that may fall on us (such as dead tree limbs, or rocks from cliffs).
Once you've found the general location, look for specifics such as high
spots. You'll want your wilderness house to sit higher than the surrounding
land, in order to shed water. Finding the general location is usually much
easier than deciding on the specific spot to build. Geri and I have spent as
much time selecting sites as we have in actual building. Ideally, we want a
small hillock just the size of our projected house. This will send whatever
rain that falls away from us. This may seem a simple thing, but on many
occasions we've witnessed small rivers running through someone's tipi at
some of the rendezvous we've attended. The water has to go somewhere—
and it always goes downhill. Digging a trench or building a retainer on the
uphill side will sometimes divert water from your bed.
\
Chapter 3: Primitive, Semipermanent Shelters 77
Floor
For all our shelters, the existing ground will be the floor. It may be padded
with leaves, grass, dirt (if on rock), or some other material to your liking.
We don't look upon the floor, as in modern structures, as something to
keep litter free. Dirt comprises most all our house floors. Softer materials
under bedding does make for better sleeping for your aching body, though.
Primitives both today and yesterday often poured blood on the floor that
then hardened and became rubbery, like linoleum. If required, or desirous,
to build in a wet area such as a swamp, you can lay a network of poles over
a framework to raise you up.
Walls
For protection from the sun alone, walls might not be needed. For
protection from just about anything else, walls are a necessity. As we'll
see shortly, the walls are often integrated into the roof with the frame.
Sometimes, however, the walls will be separate. In many cases, the walls
will also support the roof. Sometimes a single-thickness wall will do the
trick, but more often than not, for the purposes intended here for protection
from water and cold, a double-thickness wall is what we want. Wind and
sun aren't all that hard to keep at bay. The interior temperature can be
raised considerably with minimal protection. But water has a way of getting
through almost anything eventually. So, if we can get our house waterproof,
we've got it made.
We'll illustrate here how to incorporate and use rocks in one circumstance.
What we find almost as simple to construct and highly effective, when using
most materials, is a double row of sticks placed in the ground and filled with
litter. This makes for a completely airtight, waterproof wall.
Roof
To us, the roof is one of the most critical segments in a shelter. It will usually
be the one most responsible for keeping out the water, so here's where we'll
give what seems to be the most attention. A roof is what makes a shelter.
For our criteria, the roof needs to repel water. Not a really simple task,
but also not that difficult if you're aware of some basic rules.
Rule #1: Water runs down. Seems obvious, yes, but it's surprising how
many forget this when building a shelter. Most rains are accompanied by
78 Ultimate Guide to Wilderness Living
wind that pushes the water in from the side. Once water hits the roof, the
water will cease its sideways motion and begin to fall downward. What we
need to do is slow this fall till it gets beyond the inside of our house.
With a flat roof, once the water hits, it has nowhere to go but into
the house. Flat roofs don't work primitively unless we have a large rock
outcropping or something similar. Mostly, forget about flat.
Now, the steeper the pitch of the roof, the faster that water will run
down it, giving it less time to soak through the materials and come inside.
The thicker the roof covering, the more time it takes the water to
penetrate it. The finer the material used in the covering, the longer it takes for
the water to get through. Thus, coarser materials call for thicker coverings.
Long grasses make for good coverings. Water has a natural tendency
to follow the stems and leaves of the grasses. Every time the water hits an
obstruction, it will divert from its sideways following of the grass, and will
fall to the one below it. So we need the material to be thick enough that, by
the time it works its way around all the grasses and falls out the other side, it
will be beyond our living space.
Place the grass upside down on the shelter. As water follows the stems
and leaves, it will then naturally follow downward. If the grass is placed on
the way that it grows, whenever water reaches the junction of leaf and stem,
it will drip.
Smoke Hole
Since one major requirement here is the ability to use fire with (and within)
our house, we'll need some method to allow the smoke to leave.
Smoke will naturally seep out of the roof of all these primitive
shelters. We just can't get them completely airtight with the materials we
have at hand, though leaving some other opening (if kept small) doesn't
hurt. You'll see four methods in the pages to follow.
Keep the roof space high.
Rule #2: Smoke rises. If the interior ceiling is high, on days when the
smoke seems to linger, it will be above your heads. In the shelters here
illustrated using interior fires, in all cases when we've had fires, we've been
able to stand comfortably, as the smoke was sufficiently ventilated. Smokier
fires require more ventilation, so burn small-diameter, dry wood.
Chapter 3: Primitive, Semipermanent Shelters 79
Entrance
We of course need some way in and out. It would also be proper to have
some means of closing this off, such as a door.
Animal skins have been used as doors forever, whether raw or tanned.
Large pieces of bark work too, as do grasses rolled into a ball, or even a
piece of log.
Rule #3: If the lower walls are sealed tight, including the entranceway,
you'll have less trouble with moving air, and with air moving smoke around
the place.
House Materials
An unbelievably large amount of material is needed in constructing a good
shelter. The material shown here made one simple wickiup.
One thing not to do is to limit your construction to specific materials. Learn
to use to the best advantage any materials. Integrate. Mix and match.
When constructing a shelter to repel water, you'll want to work mostly
with small, grass-sized material, which will compress better. Thicker stock
such as sunflower stalks, willow, or dogwood shoots look good but require
much thicker walls to repel water, as there's so much air space for the water
to work its way through.
80 Ultimate Guide to Wilderness Living
Try any of these materials:
NfrSod ^ Stone
l^Dirt & Grass
# Wood ^ Leaves and litter
# Bark Lashing material
It is unbelievable, the amount of materials necessary to construct a good
weatherproof shelter. The larger the size, the more material that's needed.
If the house is for long-term use, make it large enough for however
many people and their supplies. The four shelters illustrated here are
designed for three to four people. Smaller shelters are easier to heat. For
interior fires, roofs must still be high.
Availability of materials should be real high on the site-selection list. It
can be tedious and time-consuming to haul materials from any distance at all.
Is there a sequence in building? Well, probably most times. I suppose it
might help to gather materials before you begin any construction, but then
again many times we'll just begin with the actual building and use whatever
we come across by way of materials.
Very seldom do we approach building with any actual plan in mind.
We just want to end with the best shelter possible under the circumstances.
Some might think that for an overnight shelter any old thing will do, but
what if you get a goose-drowner rain?
The importance of the roof is stressed throughout this chapter. The
foundation or the framework, or both, need as much attention, as they'll
hold it all together.
Do the best you can with what you've got to work with. There's not much
sense in spending a few hours in putting up a roof if it doesn't repel anything.
Warm and comfortable, the wickiup is probably one of the quickest and
easiest shelters to construct. Using any number of materials, it can be put up
in as little as an hour or so if materials are at hand. It can be built to repel
most water, and a controlled fire is possible inside.
The Wickiup
Chapter 3: Primitive, Semipermanent Shelters 81
A solid tripod is a must, since it's the foundation for all that bar k
 (lashed
follows. A "Y" in one or more of the logs or branches is loosely) to help,
important to help lock the "Y,"if no lashing is available.
We used three types of
materials for covering this
particular wickiup: weeds
and cornstalks for one third
the total, grasses and leaves
(litter) for a third, and
cattails for a third. These
were applied 6" to 8 " thick
for the most part. Thicker is
better.

This shelter can be made any size. A fire makes it cozy in a hurry, though
remember to keep it small and attended.
82 Ultimate Guide to Wilderness Living
The Lean-To
The second shelter that we illustrate here is also something of a quickie.
This is the shelter that I pretty much grew up with in the Appalachians of
southern New York State some 30 to 4 0 years back.
Now, in my estimation, the basic lean-to that most people are familiar
with falls far short of qualifying as a real "house"-type shelter. By its nature,
lean-to's are exposed in one or more directions to the mercy of the wind and
any wind-driven elements.
But when you're on the trail and using it as a one-nighter, this drawback
isn't quite as noticeable as it will then be (or should be) when built with its back
to the wind, or, if fitted with sides, possibly quartering the wind somewhat.
The wind is a fickle thing. Generally it doesn't blow exactly straight
from any one direction but constantly shifts directions a bit. This fact alone
makes sides on your lean-to a must (remember that walls needn't shed water
so much as wind). If you expect to call this shelter home for any period of
time, a coupla variations will help considerably to add to your comfort.
You'll note in the accompanying illustrations and photos that we've
indeed added substantial walls or sides to the lean-to. Also, we've extended
these to swing to the front right and left, to help block the wind. In addition
to this you'll be quick to note that we have constructed a wall of sorts to the
front of all this by several feet so that the wind is thereby blocked from all
directions. This leaves us with approximately a 2' corridor left and right to
enter by, and the fire is placed right in the middle of what little remains of
the open area directly in front of the shelter. In actuality, what we've done is
construct a chimney for our fire.
In Kansas, we generally build our shelters with the back to the West, as
that's the direction the prevailing wind comes from. In summer, though, we
face slightly north of West, and in winter we try to face somewhat south of
West as the seasonal winds shift accordingly. The day we built this lean-to,
the wind was from the Northeast (preceding a storm). The benefit of the
eastern wall was visible with the first fire, as the smoke was blown not into
the shelter but up and over it.
The basic framework of lean-to's varies slightly. Here we constructed,
though among trees, an entirely freestanding lean-to. There are a multitude
of ways of putting it together.
Chapter 3: Primitive, Semipermanent Shelters 83
We first need front supports. These
will be supporting the entire
structure, so use stout materials.
Left: We used a simple branched
stick. Right: We used two straight
sticks (lashed) to provide the "Y"
we needed. In either case, more
strength is obtained by driving the
poles into the ground if possible, or
supporting with rocks if necessary.
Into the "Y" of both we placed poles
running to the ground (or, as you
will note in the photos to follow, onto
a log to slightly raise the back).
Across these we placed three
straight poles. From now on we can
use crooked poles in the roof, and
the ceiling will still remain flat.
Here we've placed several not-sostraight
poles to tighten the roof a little.

Thatched Wickiup
With the first wickiup and the lean-to, we've made two of the quickest,
easiest shelters to construct that go one or two steps beyond what most
think of as "survival" shelters. In many true "survival" situations, naturally,
you'd be just as well off (or better off) with one of the illustrated "houses"
shown here.
But now let's take another step up the ladder in shelter construction.
The framework for the wickiup to follow can be put together almost as
quickly as the tripod shown earlier. The manner in which we'll apply the
covering over most of the frame is where we'll advance.
86 Ultimate Guide to Wilderness Living
More—actually, much more—time and effort will be spent in the initial
gathering and preparation of materials. Here we'll be thatching, meaning
tying bundles of grasses into place. This will require the use of more grass,
as the bundles are compressed when they are tied in place. So, though this
requires more time and energy to gather sufficient quantities, the resulting
house will require less upkeep over time. The bundles will be as thick as you
want (here a good 2") with three layers covering the whole as they're tied
overlapping from the bottom up, as in shingling.
Some type of lashing material also needs to be considered. In the
example shown on the following pages, we used basswood bark, which is
simple and easy to both find and strip. (Many other materials are available.
See pages 26-33.)
This style of house, in some form or fashion, has been used in most
areas around the world where the necessary materials exist (just not, as far
as I know, in the Arctic). In fact it's a common-style house in use still today
in some of the remaining primitive cultures.
While this may seem to be a difficult project at first, as in many
"difficult" projects the real "difficulty" lies in getting out and doing it. In
actuality, once the materials were all in one place, the putting together took
only about six hours' time, with three of us working.
So, let's do it.
Although we have good photos of the building process, maybe you'll get
a better understanding of the all-important framework if we line draw some
of it also.
Step #J ; Gather some green poles,
somewhat longer than the intended
shelter's height (here we used
cedar). Stick the thicker end into
the ground (several inches at least)
in some semblance of a circle or
oval or rectangle (no real rules
here—your choice). Bend them over
and where the opposing tops of
pairs meet, lash them securely (they
overlap by several feet).
Chapter 3: Primitive, Semipermanent Shelters 87
Step #2: At whatever spacing you
desire (we used approximately 18"),
lash horizontal poles into place.
These not only add stability to the
frame but are what we'll be lashing
our thatching to. The bent door
frame we just kinda stuck in (it need
not be). We find that this limits the
size of the opening, thereby cutting
down drafts.
Step #3: Cover the entire frame
completely with thatch. A good way
to save on a lot of long thatching
grass (and also create a completely
airtight lower wall section) is to
set shorter poles all around the
framework about 6" out, also placing
poles in between the existing
uprights. (They can be spaced
as close as you like. In fact, the
closer together they are, the easier
building you'll have, being able to
use shorter and shorter materials.)
The in-between area will be filled
with litter. You can build the entire
shelter in this manner, though the
roof wouldn't shed water as well as
the longer grasses do.
Note the "pointy" top. This isn't
necessary, but we find that it sheds
water better. It's nothing more than
three cedar limbs lashed together
to two cedar "hoops." This uses the
natural bend of the limb, and this all
is lashed to the existing frame.
88 Ultimate Guide to Wilderness Living
Building the framework.
Let's now take a photo journey while putting together this wickiup, to
show more clearly some of the steps. The construction of the bottom portion
of the wall can be accomplished in several ways, using many approaches—
we show only one here. The entire structure could possibly be built even
better if it all was done in this manner. This would also make it easier to find
materials, as you wouldn't be limited strictly to long grasses (though the roof
would repel water better if it had a finishing layer of thatching).
Chapter 3: Primitive, Semipermanent Shelters 89
The actual job of thatching is not such a project as you might think. Gathering is
much more time-consuming. You do need to consider just what lashing you'll use.
Here we've used basswood bark. You might find it more convenient to splice the
lashing as you go, so that you end with one continuous cord rather than tying off
at the end of each length. Make one wrap around both horizontal pole and the
bunch of grass. The bark and grass will shrink somewhat (the grass especially,
if not dried), so retying may be necessary. The tighter together the bunches
are tied, the tighter the finished job. Stagger the thatching so that two thirds are
overlapping by the next layer; this way, the entire house will end with three coats.
Thatching begins at the bottom (as with shingles) so that moisture runs off the
upper layers onto, not into, the lower layer.

Generic Shelter
We've now covered three different basic shelters—two of them quickie,
or "survival," types. In the construction of them we've seen three varying
frames and roof types, plus a simple way to build walls or sides.
When we build shelters, we usually have only a very basic concept in mind,
certainly no blueprints. Terrain and materials are the two main guidelines.
With this next house we'll approach the job at hand with a single
concept in mind: to use the rock face of one of our ravines to form at least
one side of our house (or better yet, two sides).
One benefit of this approach is the fact that, obviously, part of your
construction is already done, so you'll spend less time gathering building
materials. Another is the fact that they're also placed below ground level so
that you're additionally sheltered. Also, by placing your fire against the rock
face, you'll store up heat by day to help warm you through the night when
you don't want a fire burning (just like some houses these days use passive
solar heating principles to warm tiles and walls).
One thing to remember with this trick, however, is that many ravines are
the result of water runoff, and all of them are places where water will run.
You certainly won't want to build in the middle of a possible river that the
next rain will create. The secret here is to walk the edges of possible sites and
look for places where water won't flow. If the ravines were made due to water
running, they're still not excluded. Water won't run over all sides at every
spot. In fact, it will usually be a problem only at a few key points. You usually
won't have much trouble locating the dry streambeds to avoid. Flattened
grass is one sign, worn down to the bedrock is another. You don't want to
take shelter in your house during a rain, only to have it wash you away.
So let's take a walk through what we did here.
92 Ultimate Guide to Wilderness Living
Site selection was the first consideration. Here Geri and Bill study the prospective
site. The pluses: Rocks form two sides, for a good height of 2 1/2" or so, and
runoff will be easy to divert. One minus: The long, open side faces north—
nothing we can't overcome.

and leveling the earth. He
temporarily places the rocks

the final walls will end. The

the progress, especially when

A gap between the west and south walls serves as a natural ventilator, so we
decide to build the fire area here, covering the top with flat rocks and mortaring
them in place (using wet clay as mortar).

Wrap-Up
So there you've got it—four different types of primitive, semipermanent
shelters, using several methods of construction. Certainly not one set of
rules or blueprints to follow.
What we hope to have accomplished here is to show you how to think
a bit for yourself and use some field expedience when it comes to sheltering
yourself in a wilderness or survival situation.
As with most primitive skills, there's no one way of doing it. We teach so
that the student is capable of accomplishing the task at hand—successfully.
We show characteristics, generically, so that you can use these skills in your
own backyard, wherever that may be.
Use what you have, and do it your way.

Chapter 4
Makin' Meat - 1
I have found that many people who know of and talk, write, or teach some
survival and wilderness skills will take their students through to a finished
primitive product or skill from today backward, using today's technology to
a primitive end. I was guilty of that myself in the first of my books—using
nylon cords, steel blades, and so on. I've found that the reason that I am so
rounded in my outdoor education (like others of my ilk) is that we taught
ourselves these skills from nothing forward—how to go "naked into the
wilderness" and manage to live.
The Primitive Bow and Arrow
One example: the primitive arrow. To go from nothing, forward, you first need
some insight as to the type of wood to use—a knowledge, however simple,
of working with stone tools to peel and smooth the shaft; of making fire so
that the shaft can be heated and straightened; of working with cordage so as
to apply the fletching and point. A step up from the most primitive of arrows
requires the skills to work flint or bone to make a more serviceable point,
then to apply them well. It also requires the knowledge of boiling down hide
scrapings and other animal parts to make glue without the advantage of a pot.
That's a lot of different skills needed for a single puny (but magnificent) arrow.
In this chapter I don't delve into sinew (it's covered in Chapter 10).
The current chapter was, in its original concept, going to be just one chapter
that covers some of the various methods of subsisting in the wilderness,
Chapter 4: Makin' Neat - 1 101
beginning with the bow and arrow, but, well, I plain ran outta room. By
the time I had finished the instructions on the primitive bow and arrow,
I found that I had filled the allocated pages for one chapter. Therefore I
wrote another one, Chapter 5, which goes into the use of snares, deadfalls,
marine life, insects, and the like, so that one can subsist in the wilds.
I don't pretend to have enough knowledge of edible plants to even
mention them. It's a skill that in itself requires years, if not a lifetime, of
learning. Certainly, I have learned a little along these lines in the acquiring
of other knowledge, but I can spend six weeks or less with an individual
and teach him or her how to live well in the out-of-doors, including how
to obtain sufficient sustenance to live. In that period of time I wouldn't
even have my foot in the door when it comes to edible plants. To me, this
knowledge would be nice to know—someday.
Now, the methods that I describe here are mine. They work for me.
What I describe as cardinal rules, not to be ventured from, are broken all
the time by a bowmaker friend of mine, whose bows work great. So what I
describe isn't the only way—but they do work for me! And what I describe
as happening to the wood at various stages may not be the reality for you.
But if you approach the project thinking the way that I describe it, your
finished product will be workable, and that's what counts.
We'll be using hand tools here—not the primitive tools that will be
required in a strictly primitive situation, but modern "white man tools." The
use of stone and bone for tools is covered in Chapter 2.
I'll also be throwing in ideas and tips that I've picked from various
sources. What I put forth does work—though, as I stress, it's not the
only way. In fact, throughout the entire book, I'll be showing you how to
accomplish the task at hand, but will also keep the door open so that you
may use your own ideas to come up with other, and quite possibly better,
ways to accomplish the same end.
Anatomy of a Bow
Simply put, a bow is a stick with a string tied at each end that will propel
an arrow. To understand how to successfully make this stick bend, time and
again, to its full potential, we need a quick lesson in physics. So, pay close
attention; this is important.
• Any piece of wood of equal dimensions from end to end will bend at the
middle when force is applied. With a bow, the midsection moves in one direction,
102 Ultimate Guide to Wilderness Living
the two tips in the opposite direction. To counteract this, we remove wood from
the limbs of our bow—more from nearer the tips than from closer to the grip.
• When removing wood while shaping and tillering a bow, one equation
is of importance. If half the wood is removed in the width of the bow, the
strength is halved. If one eighth of the wood is removed in the thickness of
the bow, the strength is decreased by close to one half! What this shows is
that the bow will be more effective if it's narrower and thicker, especially at
the tips. (This is explained shortly.)
• The outside of the bend (back of the bow) will be trying to tear apart
(tension). The inside (belly) will be compressing.
• Most woods are stronger under tension than under compression.
The fibers of most woods will fail first under compression. This is followed
almost immediately by the tearing apart of the back, leaving you with the
false impression that the back failed first.
• Tillering, meaning equal bending of the limbs, is critical. If a portion of the
limb isn't bending, somewhere else is bending too much—and failure can result.
• Somewhere toward the center (between back and belly) of this piece
of wood is a neutral plane where no forces are in effect (at least, that we
need be aware of here). From this neutral plane outward in each direction,
all, or 100 percent, of the forces of tension and compression are being
exerted. Simple, yes. But...the closer to the neutral plane, the less force
exerted. So, how this affects us is that the nearer the outside (either side),
the furthest from the neutral plane, is where most of the percentage of
tension and compression is occurring. So, a higher percentage of tension
and compression is taking place in a smaller percentage of the wood. Fifty
percent of these forces are happening in the outer 10 percent of the wood.
What that tells us is that a flat outer surface will make a stronger bow
because this higher percentage of forces is spread over a wider surface. The
backs of bows, we don't have that much control over; we need only follow
the growth ring of the tree. The smaller the tree or limb, the rounder the
outer surface, and the more tension exerted in a smaller area. But the belly
we do have control over. That, we can make flat. And since the majority of
woods fail first under compression, this works to our advantage.
• Mass of the wood—the actual bow itself—slows down the working
action or response and so directly affects the performance of the arrow.
This is most noticeable toward the tips of the bow. So, the less mass (wood/
weight) for a particular weight bow, the better the performance.
Chapter 4: Makin' Meat - 1 103
• Each piece of wood has its ideal width-to-thickness ratio. Generally
speaking, the harder the wood, the narrower this is. The narrower that you
can make your bow, the more effective it will be because it will contain its
least mass. Less mass means faster performance. But...
• What we're after in our chosen piece of wood is the ratio whereby the
bow can be bent to its fullest extent (at a point somewhere around half its
length), and to have this wood not fail under either tension or compression
(all woods will fail if pulled too far). Let's assume our wood is stronger
under tension and that we have an unviolated back. All we need concern
ourselves with now is compression. All woods will fail under compression,
to some extent. Our ideal bow will fail only slightly noticeably. Assuming
that we're working with a straight bow, this is the stage we want our bow
to be in at this point in time. Each wood will be different, just as each
round from the same tree will also differ somewhat. There's no set formula.
A hardwood, such as Osage orange, will reach this stage, being thicker and
narrower than a comparable piece of, say, hickory (another hardwood).
• If a straight bow is made to this perfection, with the same length and
weight (let's say 48 " and 55 lb, and with the specific gravity, (weight) being
about equal, the narrower, thicker bow will shoot farther and faster because
it will contain less mass (2:1 compared to 8:1).
This knowledge hasn't just appeared to me in dreams but has come
from many sources, some even the aforementioned books. But the largest
contributors to making my mind think "bows" have been Jeff Schmidt, a
professor of physics whose workings with the Asian composite bow have
enlightened me as to the physics involved, and Tim Baker, who has done
the most extensive research and testing of the primitive bow of anyone I
know. To both these fine folks, my thanks for their completely unselfish
sharing of information.

The Primitive Bow
Here I'm going to cover the wooden "self (all one piece) bow, and the
same bow backed with sinew. We'll end up with a short, sinew-backed
bow common to the Plains Indians of North America. Since I go to all the
Chapter 4: Makin' Meat - 1 105
trouble of making them, not only do I make them usable but also make them
to be hung in a museum or the home of the discriminating collector. Most
of my bows are in the 55 to 60 lb. range with a 20" to 22" arrow, and that's
what we'll make here. You can make yours heavier or lighter.
Tools
Once the staves are prepared, for which I'll use a saw, a sledge, some
type of heavy knife, and wedges, the only tools that I'll work with in the
actual making of the bow will be a
drawknife, a wood rasp/bastard file,
and a pocketknife. Can't get much
simpler than that. A vise is handy
but not necessary.
Material
Almost any wood will make a bow,
but there certainly are preferences.
I have read of willow, cottonwood,
and sycamore being used by some
early Indians—not out of preference,
but because of availability. I've made
a few myself from cottonwood and
willow that work well for rabbits in
particular. I know from experience
that Osage orange makes one of
the best bows, with yew a close
competitor. White oak makes a real
fine bow, and it's a bit easier to work
than Osage. The bow that we'll make
here will be hickory—not one of the
better woods (it hasn't as much snap
as the others) but one that I highly recommend for the beginning bowmaker.
It's a truly forgiving wood and almost impossible to break. You'll feel a lot of
frustration when a bow breaks, so you might want to work with more of a
sure thing on your first try. The steps illustrated here apply to all woods.
The list of preferred woods really isn't long. Ash, black locust,
106 Ultimate Guide to Wilderness Living
lemonwood, and mulberry are some of the others. But what was available is
what was used in days gone by.
Generally the softer, more brittle woods (yew, cedar) were made into
wide, flat bows and the harder and denser woods (Osage, white oak) made
into narrow, thick bows.
Finding the Stave
The perfect stave would be straight, knot free, and resilient; would spring
back to its original shape when unstrung, not staying bent (following the
string); and would be snappy, kinda like spring steel. A lot to ask for in one
piece of wood.
I cut most all my staves green, in the dead of winter when the sap's
down (excess moisture takes longer to cure and leads to more checking and
cracking). Occasionally I find a dead limb or tree that's ready to work in one
of the hard or dense woods, though not often.
I want the stave as straight as possible, though they can be heated and
straightened to a great extent later on.
I watch for knots. Best if there are none, but I've made several good
bows by working around them, which will be explained later.
I take limbs or trunks of any size 2 1/2" or thicker. You could get by
with smaller, but I like the extra freedom of material to work with. With the
smaller size, I only try to get one good stave from the round, as it's not all
that easy to split the smaller staves exactly in half. By carefully splitting the
larger pieces I can get several staves from them.
Curing
I've read and heard of as many ways to cure out a stave as I've heard of
making bows. Some folks bury them in their gardens, from six months to six
years. Some cover the ends, or the entire log, with wax, allowing the log to
cure slowly and minimize warpage and cracking...and on and on. I've also
heard that it's best not to use kiln-dried wood.
Now, here's some of my own thinking. Green wood won't work, as its
green, wet cells are especially weak under compression and fail immediately
when bent, and also it's too slow in response to cast an arrow. The drier the
wood, the faster (snappier). Too dry makes the wood too brittle, leading to
breakage. So we need something in between.
Chapter 4: Makin' Meat - 1 107
The heavier dense woods need longer to cure than the looser-grained
woods. The densest and heaviest include Osage and white oak. The other
extreme includes yew and cedar, with most somewhere in between—like our
model, hickory.
I take all my staves and debark them, then right away I split them into
the size of stave that works out best. When debarking, take great care so
as to not cut through the outer growth ring. In fact, it's wise to leave the
slightest bit of inner bark on the stave to ensure this. I then split to separate
the heart (inside) wood from the sap (outside) wood. The heart is denser
and therefore dries at a different rate than the sap, which is a major cause of
warpage and cracking. Sometimes I can save for usable staves both the heart
and the sap woods, but more often I must choose.
With hickory I find that the sapwood is thicker than the heart, so I
usually save the sap. With white oak I save the heart, and the same with
Osage. (I know of one bowmaker who leaves the sap of Osage on the heart,
which is only about 1/4" thick or less, as it acts as a sort of lamination,
allowing for more flexibility.)
When splitting out the staves, with the bark off I can more easily see the
knots and how the grain of the wood flows. This dictates precisely where to
split. Knot free if possible, though knots in the center of the wood are not
2 1/2" wide by however long. All either wood of the heart or the sap. These
I'll hang in a covered area out of doors for about six to eight weeks; then I'll
take them in by the fire for about another two to four weeks. Finally, I make
bows from them.
I have successfully made bows from Osage, white oak, and hickory in as
short a time from cutting as this.
much of a problem, unlike knots
in the grip portion. Knots close
to the edge should be avoided
if possible (more on that later).
Let the piece of wood that
you're working with dictate the
working of the bow.
If there's an average to the
size of my staves, they would
be about 11/2 " thick by about
108 Ultimate Guide to Wilderness Living
Making the Bow
Now let's take hold of our cured stave. Plan to spend some time with it. Feel
it. Look it over very carefully. Study it.
The rules to remember now are to (1) work with the grain, following it
from one end of the stave to the other, and (2) never cut through the outside
(back, or the side away from the shooter) growth ring. This I stress as a
must, though I know of at least one bowmaker who always breaks this rule.
If the ring happens to be cut through, remove the entire ring down to the
next. Otherwise, this is where the bow is most liable to break. (3) Keep the
knots to the inside of the bow. When a knot can't be avoided at the edge,
do not cut through the natural flow of the fibers around it. Leave a bit of
a bump there, which will just add character to the finished product. Cutting
through the fibers will only weaken the limb at this point (a good friend of
mine, another bowmaker, says exactly the opposite).
When studied long enough, the bow will "appear" to you within the
stave. Follow the line of longitude grain and begin placing knots where
they'll do no harm, eliminating all that you can. Is a narrow, thick bow
called for, or one that's wide and flat? Every piece of wood speaks to you
differently, and no two bows will be exactly alike. Take a pencil and draw an
outline of your bow, making the center grip a bit longer than your hand is
wide. When you've searched out the best possible section for a bow, looked
it over from all sides, and drawn your outline, then you're ready to pick up
the drawknife.
It's easiest to work with the aid of a vise, though I have free handed
some and have also come up with several contraptions to work in the wild.
Chapter 4: Makin' Meat - 1 109
I normally first work the sides of the stave to the outline that I've drawn,
though each piece will be different. I try to do this first, because when I
begin working on the thickness of the limbs I can more accurately judge the
weight of the bow and feel the bend of the limbs if it's almost to its proper
width. At this point, keep the entire bow slightly oversized so that when it's
heated to bend, if inadvertently scorched, there'll be room to remove some.
Once the width is within 1/8" or so, begin working on the belly. Remember,
no more is to be removed from the back!
I'll begin shaping with the grip. Just do whatever feels good to you. It's
best to keep it thicker here then in the limbs so there'll be no bend, which
will cause it to kick. But careful study of old bows shows that, for the most
part, Indians didn't worry much about this. The limbs should taper gradually
from the grip to the tips. Work it slowly. Remember, once it's removed, it
can't be put back. Once I get to within about 1/4" the final size, I'll put aside
the drawknife and take up a wood rasp, as occasionally the knife will take
a bit larger bite than I want. As the limb gets within bending range, slow
down and feel your way carefully. Try to remove from the entire limb at the
same time. When it begins to show bendability, back away from the grip and
work only the rest of the limb, and so on till you get to the tip. At this stage,
110 Ultimate Guide to Wilderness Living
the limb should bend pretty evenly between the nock and the grip, but will
still be much too strong to even consider stringing. When one limb is about
where you want it, repeat with the other. The second limb will be more
difficult, as you'll be trying to match the first. Simply work slowly, a little at
a time. Keep a constant check on your progress by bending the bow over your
knee. You don't need to be exact—eyeball it, as this isn't the finished size yet.
Now, before you get too confused as to some of the terminology that I'm
using here, I'll include a short glossary of terms that I use.
Note deep cut caused by careless use of the drawknife. It's best to go slow
and easy leaving a lot for the wood rasp to do.
The back of the bow is the side that's away from you when the bow
is strung, and the belly is the side facing you. The grip is the center of the
bow that you grip when shooting. The limb is the section on either side of
the grip running to the tip. The ears, if a bow has them, are the 4" to 6" at
each tip that are bent back away from the belly, in effect shortening the bow.
Notches are the depressions cut near the tips to hold the string.
Study carefully the series of photographs below and on the next two
pages, which will take you from the raw stave through to the bow prepared
for the first heating session.
Chapter 4: Makin' Meat - 1 111

Heating and Bending
Once you've got the limbs bending pretty uniformly, it's time to do any
bending of the bow that you may need or want to achieve. Seldom do I
begin with a perfectly straight stave, as I usually save my best to sell, making
my own bows from the harder-to-work pieces.
Many bows that I've worked have required straightening, which will
be the first step. Once I get a straight bow, then I can decide how I want to
bend it to shape. Sometimes, I leave it straight. Most often I'll reflex the bow
(bend it in the opposite direction), because all woods will initially follow the
string somewhat, especially hickory. I often will bend the ears back also, but
the purpose of this is to shorten the bow and make it faster, and here we're
already working with a short bow.
Chapter 4: Makin' Meat - 1 113
I once put ears on a beautiful Osage bow that I made, a nice, 42" bow.
Afterward, I had to thin the ears to allow them to bend, because all the bend
was forced into one small area of the limbs. I had already sinewed the back
and so was unable to heat and straighten it.
The actual heating of the wood is done slowly. It can be done over an
open fire, hot coals, the flame of a gas range, or even an electric range. The
idea is to heat the fibers of the wood completely through. I apply grease
(polyunsaturated bear grease, meaning Crisco) liberally on the spot that I'm
heating. I've even tried steaming it, which takes much too long. I've heard
of others who use water in lieu of grease. Some even boil it. To my way of
thinking, the grease or water serves two purposes: (1) to help protect the
wood from scorching, which will make the wood brittle and worthless, and
(2) to allow moisture (in the form of steam?) to penetrate the fibers of the wood.
Whether that's so or not, that's the way I look at it. Whatever, it does work.
When the fibers are heated completely through, the wood will bend as
easily as it does when green. But, if kept in its new position till it cools, it
will pretty much stay there. You must be careful and not overdo it. It's easy
enough to take it too far and tear or break the fibers. You'll have to feel this
as you go. Heat, bend a little, reheat, bend some more—when it breaks,
you've gone too far! I've never had a piece break while doing this.
Some bowmakers make a jig and place the bow into it till it's completely
cooled. I just hold it in position for about 30 to 45 seconds, and it seems to
stay pretty close to where I want it. Keep the piece moving constantly over
the fire, never letting it stay exposed to the heat at any one spot for too long,
which will lead to scorching. (The purpose of leaving the bow oversized
till now was to give something extra to remove in the event that it got a bit
scorched.) If I'm wanting to bend only a small area, I'll heat an area about
114 Ultimate Guide to Wilderness Living
3" to 4" long. If the bend or twist (yes, twists can be eliminated if they're
not too bad) is spread over a longer area, heat it all. In about 3 to 5 minutes,
a small area should be hot enough to bend, depending on the thickness. I
can't overstress the importance of not scorching. Go slow.
Note scorch, the reason for leaving oversized (brittle portion will be removed).
Now, another important point: Heat and bend an area on one limb. If
there's a spot that you can also work on the other limb that won't interfere
with the spot that you've just bent (straightened), do it also. Then lay it aside
till it has a chance to completely cool. If you try to do too much at one time,
areas that have already been worked, but are still warm within, can easily
get accidentally rebent. Bending isn't something to be done at one sitting.
Some of my bows take several days to get to where I'm satisfied with them,
so don't get overanxious.
I take the bow to straight first (unless a natural bend can be used
advantageously in the finished shape of the bow), and then I do whatever
shaping I deem necessary. I have read, and heard from several sources, that
if one part of a bow is heated, you should do the same spot on the other
limb—but I don't bother about that.
Final Working
When all the heating, straightening, and bending is done, now's the time to
get down to the nitty-gritty of finishing your project.
With rasp in hand, approach the bow cautiously. You're going to
carefully remove wood to the final size—very slowly, so as not to overdo it.
Remember, it can't be put back.
Usually, but not always, the grip will need no further work. If, however,
it was left oversized, for the purpose of straightening or whatever, start there.
Work it down till you have what you want. Don't just jump in and start filing
away, though, but look it over from all sides and remove wood so that things
stay uniform.
Final shaping and bending (tillering) should be done cautiously, slowly,
bit by bit. I work one limb at a time, rasping or scraping gently with a steel
blade held at an angle of 90° (plus or minus) to the belly of the limb. I sweep
the entire length, from grip to tip. The thickness of the limb should be
getting thinner, the farther out toward the tip you go. This is a must!
Also, I've found that some students read or hear me say that the belly
needs to be flat the entire length of the limb—and rightly so. But don't
misinterpret this to mean that you can ignore the shape of the bow's back.
If the back sways south, so goes the belly. The final limb may appear like a
rough road, but it must match the back in thickness.
Bend the bow to test it, by placing the tip on the ground and applying
backward pressure at the grip. Watch the bending. You don't want to see any
one area bending. If you do, it means that excess stress is being placed there,
so you must remove material from areas above, below, or both to even out
the bend. Most every time it'll be visually apparent that areas are thicker or
thinner, simply by looking from the side. Running your hand down the limb,
thumb on the belly and fingers on the back, will often feel thicker or thinner
areas. Take your time.
All material is to be removed from the belly. Leave the back (one growth
ring) alone! Do the other limb till it looks and feels the same. Many times,
that's all I need to do to now string the bow.
The last few paragraphs won't take but a minute to read, but, in the
doing, expect to spend the better part of a day to do things right.
Remember that, when finishing, you're going to remove any scorched
areas (except from the back; if you have scorched here, it'd be best to
116 Ultimate Guide to Wilderness Living
remove one entire growth ring and start over). Scorched areas are brittle and
will break easily. We're going to be tillering the limbs, but we're not gonna
touch the back of the bow!
Carefully removing just a little at a time.
When we're satisfied, now's the time to cut our nocks for the string and
to string the bow. Here, any strong cord will suffice. (Strings will be covered
soon.) The cuts for notches can be done about any way that you like. They
need only be near the tip of the limbs, suitable to hold the string. Many old
bows had no nock at all, just a buildup of sinew to prevent the string from
sliding down the shaft. The photos show the way that I do mine. Old bows
were done in many ways. The most common method of the Plains Indians
was to put two nocks on the lower end of the bow and one on the upper
(maybe to allow them to move the string line of sight to one side of the grip
or the other). This is what I normally do.

#4—Showing how bow somewhat followed string from just one time stringing
If we've watched what we're doing up till now, the limbs should be
fairly close. Now I'll make use of a tillering board. This can be as simple as a
heavy nail or spike driven into an upright post or board, to hold the center
(grip) of the bow, with nails placed at about 2" intervals below it. With this,
you can put a loose string on the bow and stress the limbs very little by
pulling the string down a nail at a time and paying attention to how each
limb bends, both individually and as a matching pair. At the point the limbs
are bent, if you see a problem area you can immediately stop and touch up
that spot. Once the bow's bent far enough that the string at the grip area is
at the proper height (test by running another string or straight stick from
tip to tip), you can then stop and string the bow to the proper height. For
most longer bows, that height is about 6"—the height of a fist with a thumb
sticking up. For my own bows of 44" or less, I make it just fist-high (about
4"). This is called the brace height.
I'll continue pulling the string one nail at a time till I feel I'm stressing
too much, and then will remove wood from both limbs. I do this by feel, and
many times my bow will break, as I'm trying to make it too heavy a draw
weight for the wood it's made of. Most times, I'll quit long before I reach the
2:1 ratio (half the length of the bow), then I'll shoot it a lot to kinda break
it in, hoping to gain an inch or two. Most good bowyers "overbuild" their
bows—meaning that they create one at the magic 2:1 ratio without coming
close enough to the breaking point to worry about it. (I'm not that smart.)
The first thing I do after stringing for the first time is to pull easily to
"feel" how it pulls. With the short bows that I make, I use an arrow about
Chapter 4: Makin' Meat - 1 119
half the bow's length, usually 20" to 22" . I'll use a premeasured stick or an
arrow to check this. The short bows "stack up" quite fast (by stacking up, I
mean that they suddenly get harder and harder to pull). Pull gently at first.
Now's a good (or bad) time to break it. Feel it out. If the wood suddenly
feels like it won't give any more, listen to it. Remove some more wood from
the belly to limber it.
Checking bendability of bow constantly as we go.
With most of my bows, I like to end at this stage with about a 45 lb. pull
at what I've decided the arrow length to be. This I measure by pulling from a
scale. Whatever the scale reads at the full draw length is what I call the bow
weight. I don't know how the "big boys" do it. Bows can be made to pull at
whatever weight you desire, but since I back all of mine with sinew I keep
it at about 45 lbs. here. The two layers of sinew that I'll apply will bring the
bow, after final tillering, to 55 to 60 lbs.
At this point we have a finished, shootable, self bow of about 45 lbs.
draw weight with a 22" arrow.
If we were to keep it here and not go on to sinew it, it would call for
some sort of sealing to protect it from the elements. In the old days, grease
was liberally applied, and reapplied, and even some more, for the purpose
of keeping the bow limber. Most times, the bow would be heated somewhat
and then the grease (and maybe brains) applied.
120 Ultimate Guide to Wilderness Living
My thinking, again: If kept in the moisture, unprotected, for long, the
wood would soak up moisture and become weaker and subject to rot. If
kept unprotected in a low-humidity area, it would dry to the point that it
would become too brittle and therefore subject to breakage.
Whatever, you can stop here if you want. I never do. Next for me is to...
Remember what I said earlier about the ideal bowstave having the quality
of springing back to its original shape when unstrung? Well, many woods
don't possess that quality. In fact, the hickory bow that has just been made
is one of the worst for "following the string." It wouldn't be long before the
bow would be bent almost to the point that it would require no additional
bending to string it. This problem for me arises by my making the bow
narrow, trying to replicate a Plains Indian piece. It would be tempered or
eliminated if I made the limbs wider and therefore spread the stress over
more area.
Applying sinew to the back of the bow will help greatly in reducing this
tendency. It will also add strength, power, and "snap." Beyond that, it will
add greatly to the bow's elasticity. On some bows where I haven't reached
the desired draw length but haven't wanted to shave away any more wood,
I've gone ahead and sinewed and then have been able to increase the draw.
The application of sinew really does a lot for the tension of wood.
Back the Bow with Sinew
77iree strips of deer sinew, two partially separated.
Chapter 4: Makin' Meat - 1 121
Read through this section thoroughly, and understand it completely
before proceeding. This step is kinda complicated to describe, even with the
help of photos, yet the actual process of sinewing is really much easier than
describing it. When you understand precisely what you're doing, why you're
doing it, with what you're doing it, and how to do it, the actual "doing" will
be a piece of cake. Remember, also, that here we're working in the kitchen.
It's really not all that much more difficult to do in the wilds, just much more
time-consuming.
Sinew is tendon. It's available from all animals, including us. It can be
taken from the legs or, preferably, from either side of the backbone. The
sinew from the legs works, but is shorter by far than the loin sinew, and for
this reason I don't use it, though I do keep some on hand. The much longer
strips, one lying on either side of the backbone, are a lot more pleasant to
work with and are easily enough removed from the carcass of any large
animal. (See the "Sewing with Sinew" section in Chapter 10.)
Leg sinew must be pounded thoroughly and then separated into
threads. The loin sinew, if cleaned properly, has only to be roughened
between the fingers first (we're talking about 2 or 3 minutes' work here) and
then separated into threads. I try to keep the threads all about a good 1/8"
thick. I've found that three average loin strips of deer sinew will allow me to
apply two coats to the bow and have enough left over for the bowstring. The
entire process of preparing the threads takes little more than an hour.
To prepare the bow, it must be washed thoroughly. All grease and oils
must be removed for the glue and sinew to adhere, and that includes the oils
from your hands. Some wash their bows with lye. I did on two bows, though
I didn't like working with the caustic stuff and went back to my method of
a good scrubbing. A toothbrush works well, with Ivory dish soap and lots of
hot, hot, hot water, then rinsed very thoroughly. Also wash the belly of the
bow for a couple of inches down from both tips. The bow can be sinewed
either damp or dry; I've found no difference. Now, don't touch the back of
the bow with your hands again till you're applying the glue.
Also, the nap of the wood on the back of the bow must be raised so that
the glue has something to adhere to. This can be accomplished with either a
file or a hacksaw blade, working gently so as to barely raise the nap. Don't
go so deep that you cut through the growth ring. This can be done either
before or after the washing.
122 Ultimate Guide to Wilderness Living
Glue
Here I'm going to break one of my rules and make a statement that I
haven't personally tested to see whether it's true, though it's the consensus
of all bowmakers I've spoken to. "Sinew is protein. The only glue that can
successfully be used with it is another pure protein—meaning glue from
hide." This makes sense to me, and hide glue is all I've ever used with
sinew. And it does work. I haven't tried any of the other commercial glues
available. Sinew isn't all that easy to come by, and I don't want to take the
chance of ruining any. I've always had access to glue from hides, or have
taken the time to make it.
As the name implies, hide glue can be made from hide. Simply boil a
hide in water long enough, and glue will be extracted from it into the water.
If the hide is in small pieces or scrapings (or both), it will happen faster,
since it has more surface area. Bring a pot of water to a boil and add the
makin's (hide scrapings, sinew scrapings, cartilage, and so on). This is often
referred to as hoof glue, though in fact the horny parts of hooves can't be
boiled into glue—they're the wrong stuff. When hooves are thrown into
the pot, any glue produced would have come from cartilage. Anyhow, boil
away. After some time (maybe hours for larger pieces), the glue stuff will
be extracted into the water. The glue can be made thicker now by further
boiling. We've found that making it on hot rocks (depressions) or in ceramic
pots in field work is convenient for not-so-refined glue. When making it
at home or under more controlled conditions, it would be better to keep
the liquid thinner. Strain this through a filter of sorts (such as layers of
cheesecloth) and then pour out in thin layers (on cookie sheets covered with
tin foil: primitive here). The water will evaporate and leave thin sheets of
glue behind. Keep this layer thin so that the water is allowed to evaporate
Chapter 4: IYIakin' Meat - 1 123
more quickly (nothing smells quite as bad as rotting protein!), which is the
reason for the flat sheet in lieu of a bowl. Leave it in sheets, or pulverize it
for storage and when ready to use it add water and heat.
Hide glue can also be bought. Making it can be a real pain, and timeconsuming
(being hypocritical now, ain't I?), so I tend to buy most of what
I use. It's available either granulated, as I just described, or in liquid form.
I made several bows years ago using this liquid stuff. It worked, but took
forever to cure out and always seemed tacky. I read in D. C. Waldorf's book
The Art of Making Primitive Bows and Arrows that this was due to an
additive and that it could be counteracted by adding vinegar. I tried that
once but still didn't like working with it. It's not easy to find the granulated
glue at times, though. You might try art supply stores and especially places
that work with stained glass. A pound of glue will make three, four, or even
more bows, with plenty of leftovers for arrows and other crafty things.
Now that we've got all the components together—sinew threads, hide
glue, and the prepared bow—let's get going. I'll explain my setup and you
can devise whatever will work best for you.
I work with two dishpans. One pan holds the bow for easy workability,
back side up. In it I put about 1 1/2" to 2" of cold water to soak the sinew
threads. Begin by soaking about one third (one loin strip) of your threads
(assuming that you've used three deer loin sinews), or whatever. I like to
soak them for several minutes. They become elastic when soaked and shrink
as they dry, thereby adding their strength to the bow. Hot water will cook
them, warm water will cause them to curl.
While these soak, add several cups of boiling water to a handful or so
of the hide glue crystals in the second, smaller pan. This is variable, and you
don't want it too watery but also not too thick, just like a thin syrup. After a
lot of stirring, the glue will eventually dissolve in the boiling-hot water. You
can speed this by first soaking in cool water.
The working temperature of the glue should be about 115° to 120°F,
barely warm to the touch. The glue will set up fast at roughly 85° to 90°F.
I find working at a room temperature of roughly 85°F about right. I prefer
it to set up kinda quick. The hotter the room, the slower the setup time.
Therefore, you might find it easier working during the cold of winter when
the room temperature is easier to control than on a 75° to 80°F day.
Place the pan holding the now-liquid glue into a third, somewhat larger
pan containing hot water, such as a double boiler, to keep it at a good
124 Ultimate Guide to Wilderness Living
working temperature. Although the hands, bow, and glue would stand hotter
temperatures, the sinew won't, so keep it just warm enough.
Put newspapers under it all, as things are about to get real sticky.
End of bow coated with glue and one thread "ridging" the outside. I inked in a
ridge thread to make it show.
First, apply one or two coats of glue to the back of the bow, and allow
to become tacky. The purpose now is to cover the entire back of the bow
with an even layer of sinew threads, one thread deep. Try to avoid having
bunches of threads meeting at the same "joint" (butt to butt), as in laying
brick or stone; instead, overlap the threads. One by one, take each thread
from the water, squeeze the excess moisture out of it between thumb and
forefinger, dip it into the glue, squeeze out the excess between thumb and
forefinger, and finally dip it into the glue once more and again squeeze out
the excess (if the thread is left to soak in the glue, it'll begin to cook or curl).
Now lay the thread onto the back of the bow. I begin by placing the first
threads along the very edge of the bow, from one end to the other, going
through whatever nock there may be and on to the other side. If there is no
nock, as in my one-nock end, then go over the tip and down the other side
for a few inches.
When applying this first layer of sinew, I prefer to make this "ridge" on
either side of the bow, as it serves as a guideline, making it easier for me to
evenly fill the space in between. I know of others who count each thread
to make certain that an equal number is placed on each limb. For this first
layer, it's not necessary. The entire back needs to be covered, for the best
result. If the bow is tillered pretty close, the limbs should be about equal
widths anyhow. The only way that you might run into trouble is by placing
threads of varying sizes on the opposite limbs. If the threads are fairly close,
you'll have no trouble.
You'll note that I said to run the threads over the tips and down the
other side a coupla inches. If there's to be more than one coating, this
wouldn't be necessary at this time (though I do all mine this way). But
Chapter 4: Makin' Meat - 1 125
with the final layer, the threads are carried over and then held in place by
wrapping with a sinew thread, to keep the ends from pulling loose.
I invariably apply two coats of sinew to my bows. After the first is in place,
I take a 15- to 20-minute break to allow the first to set up somewhat. Also,
now should be about the time to begin soaking more threads, if you haven't
had to do so by now. For the second layer, I usually don't use quite as much
sinew as I did in the first, unless I'm trying to add power to a particular bow.
For this layer, I count the threads: 12 on one limb, 12 on the other.
These threads are all placed down the center of the bow, not as an even
layer like with the first. The threads will spread out as you apply them, and
the finished appearance will be slightly rounded. From one to three dozen
threads to each limb should do the trick here. Remember not to butt the
ends, but to overlap, and also to carry the threads over the tips and down
the other side a bit.
You'll find that you'll have to replace the hot water in your tray once
or twice, to keep the glue at its proper temperature. You'll also find globs of
glue building on the bow, caused by the glue's cooling. Just wet your fingers
in hot water and run them over the globs to smooth and remove them.
I use the pan of cool water (holding the bow and soaking the threads)
to rinse my fingers as I go along, which is often. And it's a smart idea to keep
old rags or paper towels handy to wipe with, not Ma's good towels.
When I'm satisfied with the job, I then smooth the entire surface with
fingers dipped in hot water. At the tips and at all "low" spots, where the
threads might have the tendency to pull loose while drying, take a sinew
thread and tie it down.
126 Ultimate Guide to Wilderness Living
The threads can be overlapped at the grips all they may. It won't hurt a
thing, as there's no bend there.
Take the sinewed bow and hang it from pegs or nails and leave it be.
Here in northeast Kansas with its high humidity, I leave it for two weeks
to cure. On a coupla bows that I made in the deserts near Las Vegas, I was
satisfied with the cure in one week. The color of the sinew will lighten
noticeably as it dries.
Don't even be tempted to try to pull the bow and see how it's doing,
before you're sure that it's cured. You'll only succeed in breaking the allimportant
bond between glue and wood.
The freshly sinewed bow.
When it's cured, you'll find that the drying, shrinking sinew has pulled
the bow back—and that's good. With Osage or white oak, that's where it
would remain. With our hickory, it will still "follow the string" slightly, but
not near as much as if we hadn't sinewed it.
When first pulling the bow, and probably for some time afterward on the
first few pulls, the glue will audibly crack. This will never cease to worry you!
When cured, the bow might need some final tillering. If everything had
worked perfectly and the tillering was right on, you'd be in good shape. But
most probably you'll have to loosen one limb or the other. String the bow
and pull it a few times, then lay it down and eyeball or measure it. If one
limb bends more than the other, cut any sinew ties that may be in the way
and carefully scrape or sand some wood from the belly of the stiffer of the
limbs. Do this with the bow unstrung. Remove only a little and then string
it, pull the bow a few times, and finally check it again. When both limbs are
equal (or close), the bow's all but done.
Some folks take the tillering to a more critical point. Using a board with
notches cut into it about 2" apart, they place this board on the grip of the
bow and move the string up a notch at a time, tillering at each step, till the
draw length is reached. I've found that if the bow seems closely tillered as
I've stated, it will look good all the way out. At least I've had no problems.
Chapter 4: Makin' Meat - 1 127
On one hickory bow that I made several years ago, I got to tillering and
really overdid it. What began as a 55 lb. bow, because of overtillering first
one limb and then the other, ended up as a 35 pounder. Instead of taking
an ax to it as I was sorely tempted to do, I let it sit for several weeks while I
calmed down. Then I simply resinewed it—a lot—and ended up with a fineshooting
55 lb. bow. So much for the power of sinew!
OK. The bow has been sinewed, cured, and tillered. Now take a knife
or some sandpaper and go over all unsinewed parts of the belly and sides to
remove any remnant of glue (just to make it pretty). Also, replace any ties
that you removed while tillering.
But now something has to be done to protect the bow. Not only the
wood (of which I spoke earlier), but also the sinew and the hide glue.
Remember, this is all water soluble. If we were to lay the bow in a tub of
water, before too long the glue would dissolve and the threads would all fall
off. No good, that!
It's best to figure that, on rainy days, the bow will stay at home. When it
rained, the Indians went home. And that's just about the truth. The bow was
no good in wet weather. Even if it wasn't sinew backed, the strings, which
were made mostly of sinew or rawhide, would be worthless.
The most common method of protecting the sinewed bow in days of old
was to coat it liberally with grease, with some brains maybe thrown in for
good measure. The smell? Well, I don't do mine that way.
I have coated some with a spar varnish, which didn't seem to hurt the
sinew at all, but I just didn't like the brand-new shiny look of a factory-made
bow on my completely hand-made primitive piece. I now coat all my bows
liberally with a paste wax. This coats both the wood and the sinew, and lets
me control the finish.
I've read in one source of intestines being used to cover the bow for
protection. In two sources I've seen discussions of skins of serpents (notably
rattlesnakes) being used for the same thing.
I have looked hard at old bows all my life, whenever I've come close to
them. They fascinate me. Since I began making them, I've looked even more
diligently, often taking notes and photographs. In the last coupla years I've
examined well over 100 original bows. This includes the bows on display at
the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C.; the Museum of the Plains
Indians in Cody, Wyoming; and museums and National Historic Sites too
numerous to mention. Of all the bows I've seen, probably about half of them
128 Ultimate Guide to Wilderness Living
were sinew backed, and not one of them had either intestine or snakeskin
covering. And that figure does not include the Smithsonian report of 1893
by Otis Mason on bows, arrows, and quivers; of the 43 bows illustrated,
most were sinew backed, but not one was covered.
These coverings do work. They're just not museum quality. I personally
like the neat lines of the sinew backing, and I don't like to cover what is, to
me, a part of the beauty and labor of my hand-made bow.
String
It's about time now, I guess, to make a string for the bow.
The best natural material to use here, which is what the Indians thought
also, is sinew or rawhide. Most vegetable fibers aren't strong enough for this
task, though some will work for lighter-weight bows.
I was once informed by two different people that one of the better
bowstrings could be made from the neck skin of a large turtle. I was told
that, unlike sinew or rawhide, this won't stretch when wet. Find a turtle,
"case skin" (like pulling a sock inside out) its neck, and cut the cord spirally
(like a barber pole), then stretch it and allow it to dry. This now is all that I
can tell you about it, as I've never seen one nor tried it myself—yet.
Deer rawhide makes for a good, strong, long-lasting string. Cut it in
a strip about 1/4" wide from a circle of good solid rawhide. Begin cutting
around the outside of this circle and continue till you get to the center. A
surprisingly small piece will give a lot of lace. Then soak the cut lacing till
it's pliable, double it and twist it tightly, and stretch it out to let it dry. For
heavier bows I'll prepare the lace the same, but then I will "cord" it, making
for an even stronger string. Again, do this while it's wet and stretch it to dry.
Remember, the finished string will only be as strong as the weakest spot
therein, so avoid thin spots and "scores."
Sinew was probably the favorite bowstring of old. Not only was it
strong, but also, because of its slightly elastic characteristic, sinew gave an
additional snap to the arrow as it was released. So use the leftover threads
from backing your bow, or prepare them specifically for this. It's important
to keep the threads as close to the same size as possible. One end of the
thread will be thicker than the other, so alternate as you splice in, to keep
the finished product even. I begin cording with two threads, staggered so
that the ends don't meet. You don't want the splices to adjoin, as this will
Chapter 4: Makin' Meat - 1 129
weaken the whole. Threads should also be soaked to make the cording
process easier.
Double this "two-ply" and begin cording. Kink the thread, not evenly in
half, between the thumb and forefinger of the left hand (for right-handers),
twist the individual two-ply strands tightly in one direction, and then
twist this in the other direction over the other individual two-ply strand.
(This sounds confusing as all hell, but read it slowly and carefully, and you
should be able to follow it.) Thus your two-ply will become a four-ply cord.
(Cording is covered extensively in Chapter 1.) Splice in threads as you
proceed. Many small splices make for a stronger string.
Arrow
Up to this point, you might have done everything perfectly, but, if the arrow
isn't made properly, it won't fly true. Then you might as well sharpen the end
of the bow and use it as a spear. Yes, everything said so far is important, but
if anything is to be considered all-important here, it would be the arrow. If it
won't fly consistently to where you want it, it's worthless. Therefore, much
care should be spent in the manufacture thereof.
Here again I'll stress that this is the way that I make my arrows. Not
only do they work, but they're museum-quality, Plains Indians arrows. I take
a few extra steps here that aren't necessary for you to end up with goodquality
shooters, and I'll tell you which ones you can skip over and still
end up with a suitable product. I'll also stick in, wherever suitable, other
methods of ending up with the same. / spend from 10 to 12 hours making
each arrow.
The materials that can be used for the shaft are many. The main
requirements are that it be strong enough to sustain the force of the bow
shooting it, and that it be straight. Any 3/8" to 5/8" limb, bush, or shoot is
a possible candidate. Something as flimsy as cattail stems can even be used.
In the southern parts of this country, reeds have been used extensively. As
with any other project, the Indians of old used what was available to them.
Although I have quite a variety of materials to choose from here in Kansas
(willow, chokecherry, ash cedar, and more, some of which I could cut
into lengths and then split arrow shafts from them), I favor working with
dogwood. It's abundant and makes up into real nice arrows. These I also cut
in the dead of winter while the sap's down.
130 Ultimate Guide to Wilderness Living
When cutting them, I look for shafts that are as straight and as knot
free as possible. Extra time spent now in the selecting will more than pay
for itself later on. For my shafts, I like them to be approximately 3/8 " thick
when I cut them. I finish mine out at 1/4" and, by the time I remove the
bark from them, they're just about right. If they're too thick, then I have to
spend extra time removing wood down to size.
I bundle and tie the shafts in groups of 15 or so and hang them in the
house to dry. lying keeps them from warping too severely. In two to four
weeks, they're ready to work.
Chapter 4: Makin' Meat - 1 131
Arrowmaking tools: sanding block, knife, bone sizer/wrench, and jawbone for
straightening wrench once arrow is finished.
Once you've got the cured shafts, the basic steps to a finished arrow are:
1. Scraping and sizing
2. Preliminary straightening
3. Sanding
4. Cutting of notches
5. More straightening
6.* Cutting of lightning grooves
7. Attaching of point
8. Straightening again
9.* Cresting (painting an owner's mark)
10. Fletching (put feathers on)
11. Sealing
* You can skip these steps.
As you can see, there's lots of straightening to be done. With primitive
arrows, straightening is something that you'll be doing over and over, for the
life of the arrow.
132 Ultimate Guide to Wilderness Living
The first thing to do is to study the shaft, determine the length of the
finished arrow, and place this within the shaft. All my shafts have knots.
Wherever a leaf has grown there'll be a knot, a site that will always tend to
warp. If possible, I try to place the arrow where no knot will be in the areas
that will have feathers of sinew ties (though this isn't always possible).
Knots are prone to future warping, and you won't be able to heat the area
to restraighten it if it's been covered. So it helps to watch the placement
thereof. Once this is determined, I cut the shaft to length. I don't worry
about which end is point or nock, since I'll work the entire length to the
same size anyhow.
Using the edge of a sharp knife or a piece of flint, begin scraping the
shaft, starting at the point end. Work an area about 4" to 6" long, constantly
turning the shaft as you work. When I'm able to run the bone sizer up the shaft,
I'll work up another coupla inches or so till I finally reach the nock end.
I like the sizer to fit loosely over the shaft, because when the shaft is heated
to straighten it will swell slightly. I use the same tool for straightening.
Scraping shaft (top left), sizing shaft (top right), carefully shaving any high knots
(above).
Chapter 4: Makin' Meat - 1 133
As I approach the nock end of the arrow, I cut around the shaft and
leave the last 1/4" or so of the shaft the original size, sometimes leaving the
bark on. This, done in a variety of ways, was common to many of the arrows
of old. For the most part, the American Indian didn't use the Mediterranean
(white man's) style of release, but actually pinched the nock of the arrow
between thumb and forefinger and so needed something to grip. This style of
release also strengthens the arrow at this point against the force of the string.
To look down the shaft now, you'll see that it ain't as straight as it might
be; it has lots of bumps, bends, and cricks. Really, it's not too pretty, but it'll
get better—and soon.
We now will heat and straighten the shaft, using the same bone tool that
was used in sizing. The identical process for heating the bow applies here:
slowly and carefully. The slightest scorch here will tell, and when the arrow
134 Ultimate Guide to Wilderness Living
hits something solid it will break. I normally work three or more arrows at
a time so that when I heat and straighten one, it cools while I work on the
others, and it's cooled enough by the time I get back to it that I don't have to
worry about rebending areas that I've already worked. (Got that?) Take your
time. Get the arrow as straight as you can. With some of the poorer shafts,
this may take some doing, but stick with it. The bumps of knots will look
like hell right now, but just kinda look "through" them and get the main part
of the shaft straight. Remember to keep lots of grease on the shaft to guard
against scorching. It will only take a minute or so to get the shaft hot enough
to bend.
Once you've got the arrow straight, or as straight as you can get it, you
can (or not, as you wish), wash the grease off with hot water and detergent.
This is only to prevent it from building up in the sandstone or paper in the
next step. Normally I don't wash it off.
Before, sanding with block, and after.
Chapter 4: Makin' Meat - 1 135
This next step, sanding, will do wonders for your cricked shaft. Using
two pieces of sandstone about 5" to 6" long with a groove cut for the shaft—
or with a 2" x 2" block of wood the same length, cut in half lengthwise, and
with the grooves cut for the shaft, and using sandpaper—place the shaft
in the groove and run it several times through this. Almost magically, the
"cricked" stick will take on the appearance of a lathe-turned dowel. The
length of the shaft-smoother cuts the high spots of knots and other bad
spots, leaving the lower parts untouched. After you repeat this several times,
brushing the stone or paper in between to keep it clean, you'll find that the
shaft has been wonderfully transformed.
Now return to the fire and grease or heat, and straighten again. You
should end up with a fine-looking shaft.
Many of the "old" arrows had grooves cut from the base of the feathers
to the point, sometimes two but more commonly three. These were just
slight cuts made lengthwise along the shaft with knife, stone, or bone.
Sometimes they were straight, sometimes wavy, sometimes with zigzags or
any combination thereof. The true purpose of these cuts has been lost. Some
refer to them as blood grooves, others as lightning grooves. Whatever, if you
want them, now's the time to put them in.
Cutting the groove to fit the arrowhead can require a number of
approaches. In some situations, you may just want to sharpen and fire
harden the tip. (I always think of fire hardening as removing only whatever
moisture remains in the wood.) Or you may want to splice in a blunt tip,
which is easily enough done, to make an arrow that's deadly on small game.
But for large game, we'll want a more appropriate "cutting" point. Bone
or stone may be used (the preparation thereof is covered in Chapter 2), in
which case, especially for the stone point, some custom sawing or fitting will
be in order. I use either a hacksaw or, just as often, a serrated piece of flint,
to saw into the tip of the shaft. This, in conjunction with a sharp knife, can
snug an awkward piece in little time.
Most commonly, though, because of modern game laws, metal points
will be used. About any sheet metal will make a serviceable point—including
scrap metal, part of an old fender, or, as I commonly use, a barrel hoop.
A hacksaw and a file will give you a point of your choosing.
The resulting metal points can usually be mounted snugly within a saw cut.
136 Ultimate Guide to Wilderness Living
The more common approach in a primitive situation would be to
carefully split the shaft for 1" or so up the middle, and then to cut the sides to
fit the point. Securing the point with glue and sinew will reinforce the split.
Whatever the type of point or method of cutting, I always seat the point
with hide glue, which dries harder than wood and really reinforces. I finish
it all off with a good wrapping of sinew. Pine pitch can be used for glue, or
none at all. And instead of sinew, nature offers vegetable fibers galore that
would suffice.
Now also cut the nock for the string. You'll see from the photos how I
do mine. No special advice needed here, just fit the string.
I have read in two accounts that the Indians cut the notch for the string
parallel to the arrowhead for hunting purposes and at 90 degrees from it for
war purposes. This was supposedly to allow the arrowhead to slide more
readily between the ribs of whatever game they were after. I personally think
that this is a lot of bunk, since the arrow, as soon as it leaves the string, is
spinning, if ever so slightly. But I do make mine to conform to "hunting" style.
Now's a good time to wash the arrow to remove any oils or grease,
especially where the feathers will be applied.
Chapter 4: Makin' Meat - 1 137
If so desired, now's also the time to paint, or crest, the arrow. In days
gone by, this was done to show who belonged to the meat—or scalp. Sort of
the owner's signature.
Fletching means applying feathers to stabilize the arrow in flight. This
can be a real pain, but is pretty much a necessity. A simple method, shown
to me by an arrow maker and flintknapper, was to simply tie two feathers,
one on either side of the shaft, at the point end, allowing the back end to lie
alongside the shaft. Although I haven't done this myself, I've seen it work,
very well. In a primitive situation, this would be just the ticket.
I do things a bit more complicated. I generally work with wild turkey
feathers, using the tail feathers if I have them, wing feathers otherwise.
Choose three feathers all having the same bend (same wing or same side of
the tail). Three feathers will make two arrows.
138 Ultimate Guide to Wilderness Living
Sawing of notch in nock
with serrated obsidian.
To prepare, gently pound the quill portion down the entire length of
the feather, which will allow it to split more readily. Then using a knife,
or a bone or stone tool, split it evenly the entire length. All one side of
the feathers for one arrow, the other side for another. We're trying to keep
everything as equal as possible.
Two smaller goose feathers, secured only at bottom.
Chapter 4: Makin' Meat - 1 139
Now cut the feathers of one arrow to the same length. Mine are made
between 5" and 6" inches long, though this length isn't really necessary.
Make whatever length you like. Trim the vane up at both ends for about
1/2" for tying to the shaft, and also trim the entire feather vane to about
3/8"—actually, the longer the feather, the narrower the vane. Use a sharp
knife to trim the bottom of the quill (the part to fit to the shaft) so that
the feather will lie flat. If it has any tendency to curl in one direction, cut
through the quill only on the inside of the curl wherever necessary. Just get
it to lie flat, with the vanes pointed up. Finish off by sanding the bottom of
the quill smooth. Some people remove the pith of the quill; I don't. Finally,
taper and smash the lower portion of the quill so that when it leaves the
bow it will run smoothly over your hand and the bow.
Carefully splitting feather.
Now comes the "funnest" part: attaching the damn things to the shaft in
some semblance of order. It can try the patience of most, especially me.
One vane will be applied at a 90° angle to the notch of the nock, the
other two vanes placed at equal distances from that. This allows the two
"bottom" feathers to run smoothly over the bow. Most folks color the upper
vane differently so as to be able to place it in the string more quickly. The
majority of "old" arrows weren't colored that way, so I don't do it. Begin by
running a sinew thread, wetted, around the shaft about 1/2" below the nock,
tying down the first "up" feather. Then, with additional revolutions around
the shaft, tie down the other two. Pull and push the feathers with your
fingernails so that they're in proper position, then wrap them tight. Finish by
sealing the thread with a drop or two of hide glue to hold it all in place.
140 Ultimate Guide to Wilderness Living
When this has been accomplished, begin again with the "up" feather at
the other end. Pull that smooth against the shaft and begin wrapping with
another sinew thread. Here, unlike the upper tie, don't let the sinew thread
run under any of the feathers. Remember that this is the end that will have
to run "into" your hand and the bow as it's released. The smoother that this
is kept, the better. So tie all three of the feathers at the same time, wrap a
few times with the thread, but before you get it too tight, use your fingernails
to rotate the feathers so that they lie straight with the shaft. Take a coupla
more tighter wraps, and then "bite" the edge of your knife into the end of
the quill and pull on it ever so gently so as to pull the vane tight. It'll then
lie pretty much flat on the shaft. If you pull too hard, it's possible to pull the
upper end out from its tie.
Chapter 4: Makin' Meat - 1 141
The arrow should now look like an arrow—soooooo pretty! If done
as I've described, it'll be museum quality. It's now ready to use, but here's a
historical note: I believe that about half the arrows of old had the feathers
being left as is, and half had feathers glued down. Myself, I prefer to glue
them down. So if that's what you want, melt down a small batch of hide glue
in hot water (just a bit of water here). It's best if the glue sets up fast, the
thicker the better. With a pointed stick, apply a bead of glue to each side of
the feathers. If they bow away from the shaft a bit, they can be held in gently
with the fingers till the glue sets.
Cluing down of fletching. Top view of fletching.
When all the glues have set up well, in just a coupla hours, it's wise to go over
the entire shaft with a paste wax. I'd use wax in lieu of a varnish, because
you'll more than likely have to reheat and straighten the shaft in the future.
What has just been described makes for a damn fine arrow. You can
make an equally serviceable one by not adding all the little touches that
make this a museum-quality piece. In a truly primitive situation, I certainly
wouldn't worry myself with lightning grooves, cresting, fancily applied
feathers, or perfectly sized shafts. I would concentrate on a "true" shaft,
so that it would fly straight; have a point of sorts, nothing fancy (you only
need to penetrate the chest cavity of any critter and it'll be dead, and even a
sharpened stick would do that); and have some sort of fletching. Any feather
would work, even a strip of carefully crafted bark.

Makin' Meat-2
The early mountain men of the American West proudly used the phrase
"makin' meat" to note that they had obtained sustenance, mostly by having
shot some game animal. "This child shore had starvin' times for nigh on ten
days afore he made meat," written in a journal, could be interpreted to mean
that the diarist had spent 10 days with no nourishment and then had shot
something, trapped something, knocked a bird silly with a rock, or even
found a half-eaten or rotted carcass left by some wolves.
Obtaining Sustenance in Nature
Deadfalls, Snare, Fish Trap, Atlatl, and More
This chapter delves into various methods of subsisting in the wilderness.
Chapter 4 covers how to make a bow and arrow from nature. (Actually, the
bow and arrow is quite a ways up the ladder when it comes to primitive
gathering.)
After a warning. I'll begin this chapter with a trapline, the first thing that
an experienced woodsperson would pursue if or when placed in a primitive
situation. On our line you'll note that most of the sets will be for small
critters such as mice, rats, rabbits, and birds. This is because it's an initial
primitive situation; that is, what you'd be depending on for life, if you found
yourself in the wilds with no lunch. Small things will keep you going. Large
critters will be a bonus. We'll also set a coupla fish-type traps.

HANTAVIRUS
Pulmonary Syndrome
When it comes to any study of primitive living skills, trapping
is a necessary subject. We firmly believe that trapping was, and is,
responsible for the majority of sustenance in any sort of survival or
primitive living effort.
Plants can be gathered in everyday movements with minimal
effort, in many cases, but also with a minimal return of essential
nutrients and calories (as noted in several other places in this book).
Time spent hunting, in our opinion, is time better spent on other living
projects, using the hunting tools for opportunistic moments.
Traps will catch and hold just about any form of animal life,
from fish to insects to deer-sized game, but by far the major source of
sustenance will come from small, rodent-sized animals. Consuming all
or most parts of these quarry will supply most or all of the nutrients and
calories necessary for the human body not only to survive but to thrive.
Since 1993, however, there have been 465 confirmed instances
in the United States of a viral disease, hantavirus pulmonary
syndrome (HPS), which has a very high mortality rate. The host for
this virus? Rodents.
The first reports came from the Four Corners area of the
Southwest. Several persons on the Navajo Indian Reservation died
suddenly. It seems that many of the infected people had been collecting
pifion nuts (seeds), which had been conveniently stored for them in
caches by rodents, most notably deer mice. There had been a hearty
crop of the pinon nut, which led to a heavier than normal population
of deer mice, caused, some theorize, by unseasonably heavy rains.
Whatever, the deer mouse was pinpointed as the source.
Since then, there have been cases of HPS reported in 30
states: all of the West, parts of the Southeast into Florida, up into
the Northeast into New York and Rhode Island, and even into
Canada. Three fourths of the cases have been from rural areas.

Hey folks, that's like saying that the entire country has it.
Various hantaviruses are known throughout the world (the name
comes from a river in Korea), and there are several distinct viruses (or
species). Those (un)lucky enough to contract it in Europe have only a 1
percent chance of dying, while in Asia this is upped to 15 percent. The
strains in the Americas are much more lethal. When first reported, the
mortality was a whopping 70 percent, but has since dropped to about
35 percent, probably because of better communication and awareness
among medical personnel. The higher fatality rate comes from the fact
that in the American strain (HPS), the lungs rapidly fill with fluid.
The range of the primary carrier, the deer mouse, covers most all
of the U.S. And tests on them have shown the virus to exist throughout
most of its range. Other carriers are the cotton rat (Florida), rice rat
(Southeast), white-footed mouse (Northeast), the so-called pinon
mouse, and the western chipmunk. A carrier of the not-so-dangerous
Seoul virus (distributed worldwide) is the Norway rat. The infected
rodents exhibit no visible symptoms. The list, both of viruses and of
carriers, has expanded since 1993. Human cases of HPS have been
positively identified in the U.S. as early as 1978 and inferred back to
1959.
In all cases to date, victims were infected by coming into contact
with the feces, urine, or saliva of infected rodents. Since the virus is in
the body fluids, it can be assumed that it is throughout the body. Most
cases reportedly were a result of breathing the dust of disturbed feces,
saliva, or urine of infected rodents.
If your hands come in contact with
anything that's contaminated and then
reach your mouth or nose, there's a
chance of infection.
The survival time in the environment is unknown. Periods of up to
two days on a dried surface are suggested. You can also get the virus by
being bitten by an infected rodent. So far there's no evidence that it can
be transmitted from person to person or from insects (such as fleas).
Chapter 5: Makin' Meat - 2 147
The virus is easily killed with most general-purpose household
disinfectants (bleach, alcohol). In other words, if you got a lot of nests
or feces in your woodpile, shed, or outhouse, it would be best to spray
it down with a disinfectant prior to cleaning it up. A 1 percent (1:100)
dilution of household bleach is suggested for wiping down potentially
contaminated surfaces. A more concentrated dilution of 10 percent
is suggested for heavily contaminated areas such as nest sites. A fresh
solution should be mixed daily.
Just how concerned should you be ? Well, of deer mice tested in
three counties of western Kansas in 1993, 9 percent were infected. We
live in north central Kansas, so that's getting pretty close to home.
You don't have to stick your head in a
bucket of mouse scat and take a deep breath
to become infected. One sniff is all it takes.
Something as mundane as moving the woodpile, with the
accompanying mice and packrat nests, becomes hazardous. A little
mathematics: Using 9 percent as the baseline, if there's one mouse nest
in the pile, there's a 9 percent chance that it's infected. Two nests, 18
percent. If among all the wood we move around here there are nine
nests, there's a 100 percent chance that we'll come into contact with
HPS. If infected, there's a 50 percent chance of dying from it. That
doesn't sound like good odds to me.
For clean-up of rodent contaminated areas, the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends the complete wetting
down of the area with a disinfectant, wearing of an approved respirator
(in enclosed spaces with heavy, active rodent infestations), wearing of
rubber gloves, washing of the rubber gloves with a disinfectant when
finished, followed by the washing of your hands and burying or burning
of any suspected materials. Whew!
Symptoms are flu-like: fever; muscle aches; abdominal, joint, and
lower back pain; headaches; cough; nausea; vomiting; and diarrhea. If
any of these symptoms are exhibited, in a period up to six weeks after
possible exposure, seek help immediately!
148 Ultimate Guide to Wilderness Living
Since there's no known curative drug,
prompt medical attention is a MUST to
increase the chances of survival.
How does this affect us primitives? Let me tell you that Geri and I
don't mess with mice and packrats very much anymore. Recommended
precautions for campers and hikers, besides the obvious steps of
avoiding contact with nests or burrows, include not sleeping directly on
the ground—though, for us, that's as natural as making cordage. Mice
pee everywhere they go, leaving a scent trail, so sleeping on the ground
increases the risks of your breathing this.
This is serious business. One touch or
sniff and you're in trouble.
And yet...trapping, like friction firemaking, ranks right up there at
the top of the primitive's priority list. Can we discontinue this practice?
Should we?
We still teach and write about the importance of traps, and also
how, in a real survival or primitive situation, we may have to depend
on some rodents. We have to. Primitive living and survival demand this
knowledge. In a survival situation, the risks must be weighed. True,
the human body can go several weeks without any food at all. But we
stress staying away from the mice and other listed carriers if, and when,
possible. Each individual has to make his or her own decisions.
Knowledge, awareness, caution, and weighing of the facts of the
personal risks by each individual are in order.
The list of concerns grows constantly. What was considered safe
yesterday just might not be today, or tomorrow.
Suspect all rodents. Put off limits those that are, for sure, hosts of
this deadly virus. Packrats, and wood rats, are not on the list—yet. So
what do you do if you catch one? Or a squirrel? A muskrat? Weigh the
facts and the situation.
Heat kills. HPS is a fragile virus. If all portions of the rodent are
subjected to a high-enough temperature, the disease is killed. The safest
way that we've come up with to handle this would be to, first, not
Chapter 5: Makin' Meat - 2 149
handle with the hands. Shove a stick in its mouth or butt, and be careful
of any blood or other fluids. Singe the hair off, scrape with another stick
(burn the sticks, trying not to inhale the smoke), and place the critter
directly in the coals. Or boil it. Or roast in a makeshift oven. Fry it on a
flat hot rock. Whatever you do, don't handle the animal until it's been
well cooked, meaning until the meat isn't pink and even then-some.
It should reach 140°F (better yet, 160°) for at least 20 minutes. (This
message comes to us direct from the CDC.)
Carrying the suspect animal in a basket will require the burning of
the basket. The danger lies not so much in the cooking and eating as
in the earlier handling. A rock or log falling on an animal is enough to
literally squeeze the pee outta him, and breathing the fumes can infect
you. Use caution!
The above was written by me in 1996 and updated for this book. I
wish to acknowledge Michael H. Bradshaw and Liz Boyle, Extension
Specialists at Kansas State University, and Lori Miller and Kristi Busico,

information contained in this chapter. When I first contacted them,
they were kinda at a loss for answers pertaining to HPS and the eating
of mice. It just wasn't one of the areas that they study. The information
presented here was gathered with their help.

Some or all of the trap types that I will show are illegal in many states
(possibly most). Check your local regulations. Also, one of the trigger
mechanisms I'll discuss can easily be set to hurt, maim, or even kill large
game, including the human species.
What I'll show is how you can subsist in a truly primitive or survival
situation. I'll explain how and where to place some of the sets so as to
possibly catch some of the larger species of game, from which (besides just
nourishment) you could derive furs, skins, sinew, and bones (dealt with in
150 Ultimate Guide to Wilderness Living
other chapters). Some of the traps, if left set around your home or grounds,
could be detrimental to the well-being of your neighbors' cats, dogs, or
children. Use caution!
One big thing here is to think small. Mice, packrats, minnows,
crawdads, insects—all will sustain life. If you were to approach your
primitive situation thinking only of larger game, you might starve.
Something else to think about: You could eat only the meat of wild
game for weeks on end, and starve anyway! Wild game isn't marbled with
fat, unlike our usual diet of domesticated meat. Creatures in the wild are
running around for their very lives, and don't build up large stores of fat.
You may have to break prejudices of eating habits that you have. In
a primitive situation, especially if it's a case of survival, you may have no
choice what goes through your mouth. Basically, the hair and skin and
intestines will go out, the rest will go in, except larger bones (you'll roast or
boil the larger bones and remove the succulent marrow). Cooking methods
are given in Chapter 7.
A story that I read somewhere: During the last century a ship was ice
locked in the Arctic and the crew taken in by the natives. Come spring, all
but one (or two) were dead and the authorities at first thought that the Inuits
had murdered them, till it came to light that the white man ate only the red
meat, whereas the natives ate almost the entire animal. Stomach contents
and the marrow of the bone didn't appeal to the whites, so they fastidiously
starved to death with full stomachs. Something else for you to be thinking
about before taking to the wilds.
Various plants can make up much of the diet, but I can't go into that as
my knowledge on this is extremely limited. There are many guides on the
market to fill your appetite for edible plants.
Once there's enough meat on hand in your camp, I'll show you the old,
natural way of preserving it. Do remember, though, that if you get bad meat,
bad tallow, or bad berries, I assume no responsibility for...bad bellies.
The Trap Line
One thing that just about all outdoorsmen, woodsmen, and survivalists
will agree on is the fact that the trap line is the most expedient method of
keeping a supply of meat on hand with a minimum of effort.
Chapter 5: Makin' Meat - 2 151
If, for some reason, you're on the move, a couple (or several) traps
might be set out each night. But if you're in a good area that supplies all
your needs (food source, water, and shelter) and decide to spend some time
in one location, then there you'd set out one or more "lines." By line, I mean
a certain number of traps set in any given location—up a certain creek, or
along a certain ridge, or south of camp or north of camp, and so on.
I'll only mention a few tips that apply to trapping. It's a profession in
itself, and there are numerous books on the market to teach you the art
of trapping any particular type of critter that you decide to specialize in.
The same with hunting techniques. I can't begin to impart to you all the
knowledge necessary to become one with nature—that's up to you. Instead,
I'll give you the tools and information necessary to begin. It's up to you
to apply them, but you'll have to be aware that you can't catch it if it ain't
there—so look for fresh signs and then trap or hunt accordingly.
Also, here, with the deadfall and snare, I'll show you one trigger
system (actually, now three of them). There are several that are shown, and
shown, and shown in survival-type and outdoors books. I've tried a few of
them. None works to the satisfaction that I desire, and most are, I believe,
only perpetuated myths. They look good on paper and sometimes seem to
work—and so are included in any or all books dealing with this subject.
I thought for a long time about how I could get a 80 to 100 lb. rock to
fall where I wanted it to and when it was supposed to, nearly 100 percent
of the time. And yet have it be simple enough to set that the entire time,
from making the trigger to the finished set, took only a few minutes. I spent
one year showing the trigger system that I came up with to any and all
outdoorsmen that I came across. No one has yet been able to say that they
knew of it, and all agreed that it does work.
So pay attention to the accompanying photos and what I say, then
go out to your backyard and make it work. My first set, from the initial
inspiration to completed working deadfall with a 123 lb. rock, took right at
20 minutes. Your first should take no more time than this.
To make this work, you'll need about 12" to 15" of cordage (see Chapter
1 for details).
You'll see from the photos that the trigger needs to be shaved down
somewhat at one end, to hold it in the knot of cordage on the other piece of
the trigger.
152 Ultimate Guide to Wilderness Living
Well, hell, I'm not even gonna try to describe this system in words.
Instead, I'll just insert photos and write captions for them. Actually, some
photos won't even need words.

My trigger system—so simple, so

wilderness situation, and so
effective.
The most efficient part
of this trigger is that it's
set before you position
your 100 lb.-plus rock—
in this case, 123 lb.
The baited, set trigger. A
scrap of meat is
held to it by cordage.
The trigger fits into the
cordage tied around
the stick driven into
the ground. Round on
round. The slightest
"busying" of the bait
will release it all.
Chapter 5: Makin' Meat - 2 153
Note that a separate piece of cordage is tied to the weight-holding stick, to pull it
when the spring releases. Initially I used the spring stick to push the upright out,
but here the spring is less likely to push away your supper along with the stick.
Always remember to use dead or dry sticks for the spring sticks. Green ones
will conform to the bend and lose their spring.

The same trigger system set as a snare. Bait is on the trigger, noose is on the
ground. Many, many applications for this.

once, with the noose drawn up but no evidence of any critter. The other two

be just the right size—too large, and animals will run through it; too small, they'll
only push it aside.
156 Ultimate Guide to Wilderness Living
In my morning's mail some years back was an envelope from Steve
Watts, a primitive-skills instructor for the Schiele Museum of Natural
History in Gastonia, North Carolina. Quoting his note: "John: Hope all is
well with you. I just ran across this deadfall trigger (a new one to me). It's
like greased lightning. Got it from Henry Rhyne (a local old-time trapper).
Henry says that he got it from a trapper in Alaska in the 1940s. Says it was
mostly used for birds. You might already know it, but as I say, it was a new
one on me. Take care—Keep it up. Steve."
Well, Steve, and folks, it's also a new one for me, and it does work. Of
all my inquiring about deadfall triggers, and of all the folks that I ran into
when I was preparing this chapter, this is one that works. Steve's initial
response to my inquiry was that he knew only the old standbys (which I
don't mention here, because of the percentage of failures). So now you have
another good, usable trigger. Where this would come in the handiest is on
hard surfaces where driving the second trigger piece into the ground would
be out of the question. The drawback would be the careful carving necessary
on hardwood.
The four views of the trigger
sent me by Steve Watts
should be self-explanatory
Bait is placed under a rock
or a "live box" (meant to
capture a critter alive, rather
than killing it). The slightest
downward pressure to the
stick releases it all—as
Steve says, "like greased
lightning."Bait can be
placed on end of stick or
ground, as birds will perch
on it to eat.

Geri and I went once to a weeklong "Cave Man's Convention" in
central Oregon, hosted by Jim Riggs and Brian James. What a great sharing
of primitive skills that mostly, but far from all, dealt with flintknapping.
One of the other tips gleaned was Jim's old standby, the Paiute deadfall
trigger system. This does work, but with much difficulty when setting heavy
falls for large game. (The same applies to the second trigger sent by Steve.)
But when setting out many traps in your line, you can't know too many
triggers. Where one might be just the checker for a particular set, another
might not be at all usable. Pick and choose what works best for your
situation as it arises.

Riggs, a Paiute deadfall trigger. Top:
Jim checking out my work. Bottom:
Front view. Study the two photos
carefully, as they show all that's needed
to construct your own. The upright
and horizontal trigger pieces and
the cordage are all the same length.
The short piece tied (or through a
loop) to cordage needs to be stiff.
The lower thin piece going from that
to the bottom of the rock could be a
stout stem of grass, as little force will
be applied to it. Bait is placed where
the thin stick (or stem of grass) touches
the rock. Jim's only comment about
my setting of this was that the upright
shouldn't jbe under the rock, just in
case the horizontal fails to kick it free.
When touched at bait, though, the rock
fell as it was designed to. Also, not
visible but very important is the slight
groove cut into the top of the upright
to hold the horizontal.
158 Ultimate Guide to Wilderness Living
I've always believed in the power of photographs, but with these traps
we've had some questions posed as to their construction, so we're now
including line drawings of three of them to help clarify.
The only change you'll note is with the construction of the Paiute
deadfall. This trigger I've always touted as the easiest and fastest to make,
but the hardest and most time-consuming to set, so we seldom, if ever, used
it. But exasperation finally got me to experimenting. Two changes, and our
trapping world turned over! Now this trap is what we use for our bread and
butter. It's fast and easy not only to construct but now also to set. With basic
instructions, we've had 10- and 12-year-olds setting them in mere minutes.
And it has been proven in the field.
The modified Paiute deadfall trigger, two major changes, both in the upright
stick. 1 ) Use of a natural T" to support the horizontal piece and 2) pushing the
upright into the ground to stabilize it... this being the most critical change. Just
insure that the upright is far enough out to prevent the weight from falling onto
it or even brushing against it which will slow it down. For most efficiency, keep
the two wood pieces at approx. 90° angle - which will keep the string at
approx. 45°.
Chapter 5: Makin' Meat - 2 159
This trap is slick but much time is required in making it - a hard wood is
more effective because the four contact points will round easily if made
from softer woods ... and once rounded, it becomes a real trick to set.

The following trap was shown to us by Gordon Nagorski of Ontario, Canada.
The basic setup as shown (left) from the front quarter and from (right) the side.
This is a good set, so the front will be the entrance.
Left: The setup (before making
"step" on bottom stick or trigger).
Study closely how this is put together,
referring back to the close-up of the
upper part of the trigger. A single
piece of cordage is looped around the
deadfall log and over, very near the
rounded tip, of the trigger. The bottom
of the trigger is held by a stick going
crosswise between the slanted pieces
stuck into the ground (and tied at
the top).
A cord is run from the cross stick to
the step stick (bottom trigger),
tying it above the ground so that
stepping on it pulls the top cross
out, thus releasing the upper trigger
and killing log.
Chapter 5: Makin' Meat - 2 161
The set made into a cubby. Bait is placed beyond the "step." Two smaller logs
can be placed at the front so that the deadfall log will fall between, thereby (you
hope) breaking the back of the trapped critter. Distance from where the "dead
falls" (ha, gotcha there!) to the step is critical. Remember that the animal's front
legs will be on the "step," and place it accordingly so that its midback is under
the falling log.
162 Ultimate Guide to Wilderness Living
Geri pushes on the step and it all comes tumbling down—fast! Note trigger
flying off.
OK, now you've got a working knowledge of three good, working trigger
systems that are really simple to put together in a primitive situation. Now
let's set up a line. Remember, think small. If by chance (in most parts of the
country, a good chance) you have a packrat's house in the area, that would
be a great place to set as many as six, or even more, sets. Here a family unit
might run as many as six to eight critters. Packrats are a reasonably goodsized
animal and worthy of your attention. Just look for signs that the house
is occupied (fresh tracks, scat) and set wherever is convenient. Rats are
inquisitive and won't need anything fancy to attract them to your set. Any
scraps from a previous kill will work as bait, or perhaps some grass seed
chewed up well (by you) and made into a paste. That'll get you started. We've
even had deadfalls tripped by rats chewing through the cordage—maybe lured
by the grease residue left by our fingers?
Most of the critters that we're now looking for will leave definite trails
in their wake. Rabbits, mice, and that scale of critter will use the same runs
Chapter 5: Makin' Meat - 2 163
time and again. Their trails will be visible to the naked eye in the grass and
leaves. These will make good places to set snares, or just off the trails for
baited deadfalls and snares.
If the "right" pool of water is available, you can put out a stout snare.
Most all critters that you're trapping will eat your snare material (if you're
using natural fiber cordage), and actually do include it in their daily diet.
You need to kill them, or in this case preoccupy them with staying afloat, so
that they won't consider turning around and biting your cordage in two. Just
give them a chance to drown.
This is one good reason to use deadfalls in lieu of snares whenever
possible. Even if you were to catch a rabbit by the hind foot and it wasn't
able to reach the cordage (which is unlikely), the ruckus that it would
make would attract a coyote or fox, and your dinner would be gone come
morning. So, a good lesson here: deadfall whenever possible.
Here's an idea for catching big meat with a snare (of course, you can see
just how you could easily construct a deadfall of almost any size, using the
first trigger system illustrated). If you've ever spent time around a campfire
in the woods, you've surely heard noises just outside of the circle of light, or
maybe even seen eyes reflected in the light, or spotted fresh tracks around
(and sometimes inside) the perimeter the next morning—signs of coyotes,
raccoons, deer, or large cats. A snare on the ground with a trip cord hooked
to the trigger or a baited snare set just might get you a larger critter tied up
long enough for you to grab your club or spear and apply a fatal wound.
But use caution! Have a torch ready, or some other light source. I'd hate to
run blindly into the dark and try to knock a mountain lion or bear, whether
a grizzly or a black, on the head with a stick. And also know the legalities
involved. You might get away with these tricks in a survival situation, but
on a weekend campout I doubt that your local fish and game commission
would turn their heads while you practice your survival skills. Do your
practicing on rats and rabbits (if legal in your state).
Set yourself up several lines. Each line might have as many as 50 sets, or
as few as 8 or 10. Each situation and locale will be different. Once the lines
are in place, it'll take only a glance to check each set, and only a minute or
two more to reset if necessary.
All the time that you're in the primitive situation, remember that you'll
also be gathering materials for cordage, fire making, bowstaves, arrow shafts,
workable stone, bones—anything to make life a little easier in the wilderness.
164 Ultimate Guide to Wilderness Living
Now, let's not forget about our feathered friends. I don't know of any
birds that you can't eat (though you'd better not take my word for that, and
maybe do some research on this), but there are some that I would prefer not
to eat under normal circumstances. I once tried coot!
Like birds, rodents are food, protein, something to keep you going.
The deadfall trigger sent by Steve Watts, as he mentions, is superb, and
probably designed primarily for birds. Our heavier-duty deadfall trigger
shown will easily get your crows or raptors (Caution: Raptors are protected
federally), because meat can be used as a bait, though in most of our sets
the bait is hidden from the view of birds.
A net is an ideal way to get all types of birds. The one shown on the
following page is very loosely "woven," not "netted," but will catch and hold
all birds, as they'll naturally spread their wings when trapped and become
further entangled. The net shown is approximately 3 1/2' square and can
be triggered by the bird (as shown), or the watching trapper can just let go
of the cord and drop it on the birds whenever he has a full-enough house.
If you stand by to manually release the net on a given animal, the net is
assured relief from a lot of damage if catching a large bird, coon, possum, or
coyote. Although the net might hold any of the above (especially a turkey
or duck), it wouldn't for very long. Any of these critters would make short
work of your net, which will have required many long hours on your part to
assemble. If you were to drop it on a bird or birds, or a small critter, a quick
run over and a thump on the head with a club (or wringing of their necks)
will keep them from damaging the net.

166 Ultimate Guide to Wilderness Living
Also as regarding the trap line, let's not forget about fish. If you
find yourself close to a water source that supports fish, the use of the
impoundment shown will often corral you plenty of nourishment. You can
also make a "minnow type" trap out of any straight shoots or limbs.
With some practice, you can teach yourself to be fast enough to catch
hold of crawdads as you turn over rocks in river or stream. Their tails are a
delicacy. Frogs are not to be forgotten, either.
Also useful, though not really a trap, is the bank line. I've seen drawings
of several types of primitive fish hooks, but from personal experience I know
just how much a fish will fight, and I know that most of these makeshift
hooks of bone or wood, or both, just won't hold up to the strain. One that
does work is a straight piece of limber or hard (not brittle) wood or bone,
kinda like a rounded toothpick is shaped, with a line tied around the center.
This is inserted into a minnow, small frog, insect, or toad and hung from
a limber stick stuck into the bank. The bait or hook needs to be a little
below water level, just slack enough to allow the fish to swallow the bait or
hook. Even intestines, scrap meats, or fats can be wrapped around the stick
or hook. Fish will swallow this bait, and, once inside their body, the line
(since it's tied to the center of the hook) prevents it from being removed or
regurgitated. If the cordage is strong enough that the fish's teeth don't wear
it through, you've got meat. If you're camped near a water source that will
adapt to this, you should put dead leaves and similar materials on the pole
to alert you to the fact that there's a fish on, so you can get to it immediately
before its teeth cut through your cordage.
Left: A pair of "gorge" fish hooks, made of green cedar for large catfish (use
smaller hooks for smaller fish). Right: Baited with scrap meat and tied to cordage.

Bankline set (actually, you can barely see a second), with limber poles stuck
securely into the bank. Ceri is making a fish trap in background.
The same net shown for birds will also catch fish, except here make sure
that all weavings of the cordage are tied. (Otherwise, learn to "net"—though
that will require more cordage.) The result is a gill net, and it really does
work. Fish swim into it and become your supper.
And while you're messing around the water, keep an eye out for
freshwater clams. Maybe they're not as tasty as their saltwater cousins,
but they did sustain the early Indians. The muddy taste they have can be
somewhat relieved by letting them sit in clean, fresh water for several days.
My experience with them has left a bit to be desired, but in the primitive
state I'm certain that they would improve in flavor considerably.
Well, that basically is what I have to offer on traps. But do remember
that the best-made trap set will catch you nothing if it isn't set where the
critters are. Learn to look for signs, and set accordingly.

Gathering
Now we'll go into some techniques for gathering—something that the
primitive person will be doing from the moment that he or she becomes
primitive. You will never ever stop "gathering." Your only tools needed here
will be the rabbit stick (also called a throwing or digging stick), a sack or
basket, and knowledge of what to gather.
The "rabbit" stick is only a limb or other piece of hardwood, from 18"
to 30" long (mine is 27"), heavy enough to go through grass when thrown at
rabbits, birds, or whatever, yet light enough to be thrown easily with force.
Pointing it at one end will enable you to use it also for digging various roots
and tubers. This tool is amazingly effective.
Once you've become accustomed to throwing it accurately, you'll have a
fair chance of hitting a critter at up to 100 feet. You may spot a rabbit (look
for its eye) before it dashes. It often will run only a few yards and then stop.
Often, once you've put a rabbit to flight, a sudden yell or whistle will stop it
long enough for you to get a shot. And how often have you almost stepped
on a pheasant or a covey of quail before they took to flight? Pheasants in
particular seem to hang in midair for several seconds, allowing you a good
chance for a hit at 10 to 15 yards. If you miss, though, watch where your
stick lands, not the bird, or you'll lose both. If nothing else, a "rabbit rock"
will work if you're decent with a baseball. (It has worked for me, and I'm a
terrible thrower.)
My personal throwing stick. To make this a rabbit stick, I need only to throw it at
a rabbit. It makes quite a whooshing sound as it travels. Thinning it somewhat
would help that. From this the boomerang developed. Although a rock would
go where this wouldn't, through brush, on open ground, or in the air, this cuts a
swath of 27", so I needn't be quite so accurate.
170 Ultimate Guide to Wilderness Living
Turn over logs and rocks, and if you're quick enough you'll be able to
club surprised mice, rats, or lizards. Be cautious of snakes while doing this,
but don't be afraid to club or stone one should it be found. I know of no
snake that's not edible (be sure to check this out if unsure). Of course, with
rattlesnakes, copperheads, and water moccasins, leave the head alone—as
that's where the poison sacs are. The only other poisonous snake in North
America is the coral snake, found primarily in the Southeast. I would not eat
this snake till I learned more about it, as it's a highly venomous snake whose
venom affects the nervous system. Fortunately, you normally don't have to
worry about being bitten by one because of its small size and mouth.
Making sacks and baskets is covered in Chapter 8, though it really
doesn't take much know-how to put together some container in a wellstocked
woods, especially with a knowledge of cording (see Chapter 1).
A real simple weaving will make a tight-enough sack from almost any
cordage material. And limber shoots of willow, dogwood, and similar plants
will make a simple basket, requiring no special skills or knowledge.
Seeds and nuts will be some of your most valuable additions to your
diet. You may be wise to check which few aren't edible (such as poison ivy,
sumac, or oak), but most are OK. In fact, they're much better than OK. The
nutritional value of seeds and nuts is amazing. (Here I'm stepping somewhat
out of the realm of my knowledge and into edible plants, so double-check
what I say here.) Any grass seed should be welcome. Fruit seeds abound
in nature. If in the timber, look for nuts. Acorns can have a bitter tannic
removed by leaching several times in water. White oaks have the sweetest
acorns (I read that in several places). These all can be ground into a flour, or
added to soups and stews as is, and many can be eaten raw. These will be an
important addition to your diet.
I can't stress enough that you'll have to do your own
research on edible plants—not within the scope of this book.
Here's a tip given to me by a friend who had read it somewhere (take
it for what it's worth): Tear apart a packrat's house (only in an emergency,
as it is his house), maybe after having trapped it as well. The packrat will
have stored various seeds and tubers within. Also, its downy beds will make
great tinder for making your fire, and will come out dry under the wettest
Chapter 5: Makin9
 Meat - 2 171
conditions. If you tear apart the packrat house while still occupied, keep
your rabbit stick handy. When the packrats first come out, they will be really
confused and slow to find shelter or cover. Make meat!
Atlatl
The atlatl, or spear-thrower: What a beautiful and efficient tool and weapon,
used for thousands of years before the discovery of the bow and arrow.
And when you watch someone proficient with this tool, such as two world
champions I know, you begin to understand just why the bow was so slow
in coming of age.
Distance throws of 70-plus yards are simple with an atlatl. Pie-plate size
accuracy at 20 to 30 yards isn't uncommon with practice, plus it's done with
all the force necessary to kill large game, such as bison and even mastodon
(it's said) in days gone by.
The atlatl (or thrower) itself isn't difficult to construct. (This Aztec word
is pronounced roughly ought-lot-uhl.) As you can see in the photos, it's
nothing more than a cheater, an extension of your arm. Most atlatls average
15" to 20" long. Not only does it extend your arm to create more force, it
also takes that force and concentrates it at the end of the spear or dart,
not in the middle (as in the case of a hand-thrown one). The spear actually
bends from the force of the atlatl, thereby creating an additional force as the
dart snaps away. And if the atlatl is fine-tuned to the weight of the dart or
spear that it's throwing, it will also have a light pliability to it that will "snap"
in tune with the dart or spear, in turn producing even more speed and force.
As with the arrow, you'll spend more time making a spear or dart (I'll
refer to it as the dart from here on out). The darts run from 4' to 7' in length,
with 5' to 6' being the more common length. Much time will be spent in
straightening it, as with the arrow (refer to Chapter 4).

Front and side views of my atlatl. The weight is to counterbalance the weight and
length of my darts, but I got a bit carried away and it's somewhat sluggish. Still,
I have the advantage of a built-in war club if I run out of darts. (Most original
models had no counterweight.)
How I cut foreshafts to fit the dart. This way isn't authentic and requires more
care in fitting, but it helps more in preventing splitting of the dart when you just
might miss your target and hit something more solid. I use antler tips for general
shooting. Stone tips would have been used for hunting.

Atlatls and darts done the old way. No counterbalance on the atlatls; foreshafts
done the way that they were. These were made by my friend Jim Riggs of Oregon,
who also took the photos.
Chapter 5: Makin' Meat - 2 175
Insects
With insects, more so than with the other critters mentioned up to this
point, you may have to really overcome prejudices. To go into any detail
as to the edibility of various insects would require a book of its own.
(Butterflies in My Stomach and Entertaining with Insects by Ronald L.
Taylor are two good sources; both are out of print but can be found in many
libraries.) I include here much useful information on the eating of many
common insects. For more details and information on nutritional values I
recommend the above books.
Grasshoppers, crickets, and termites, oh my!—all are edible.
Earthworms, yeah! Maggots, too. Most grubs. Just about any water insects.
Caterpillars, generally (but avoid the hairy ones, or any brightly colored
ones, or those with a disagreeable odor). In fact, the above rules of brightly
colored and strong, disagreeable odors should be pretty much followed
anywhere in nature. It's nature's way of warning off predators—including us!
Wings and legs should be removed from most, such as the grasshoppers
and crickets, since they're hard to digest. I would cook any insect that I had
my eye on eating. I've heard from some that this is unnecessary, but I still
have that slight fear of parasites. Drying and grinding them into a paste or
flour and eating them, or adding them to soups or stews, are other ways to
include this nutrition to your diet. (See Chapter 7 for various methods of
cooking in a primitive situation.) If you're worried about eating the contents
of these critters' intestines, just impound them somewhere for a few hours
and they'll empty themselves out. A favorite of many students, especially
kids, is grasshoppers, the legs pulled off, cooked on a hot rock, with a
texture similar to shrimp.
To help overcome your prejudice of eating insects, just remember that
they eat leaves and grasses—and do you know what chickens and hogs eat?
Meat Preservation
Once you've stocked up on provisions, you'll also need to know how to
preserve some of your excess for the days that you have nothing—either
for the long, late-winter nights or for a journey. The simplest and easiest
primitive method is simply to air dry it. Just about anything can be
preserved by drying, even watermelon (though you might not have much
left when done).
176 Ultimate Guide to Wilderness Living
In this chapter, we're thinking mostly about meats. In other words,
jerky. What the aboriginal and early settlers used for trail foods and
emergency food stores was known as jerked meat. This was simply meat, cut
into thin strips (I've read that 1/4" or less thickness will keep the flies from
blowing, laying eggs, on it; experience has proved this out), laid over racks
and sun dried.
If the weather was wet, meat was dried slowly in the smoke of the fire
(which, by the way, was the only time that the early folks flavored their
jerky—from the smoke—and that wasn't intentional). After a day or two or
three, the meat had been dried (jerked) and was ready for storage, usually in
rawhide containers to protect it from moisture. If kept dry, it would literally
last forever. All the meat loses through this drying process is moisture. All
nutrition remains, but remember, it has no fats.
The jerky can be chewed as is (and chewed, and chewed, and chewed),
or it can be, and most often was, pounded and boiled and added to a stew,
into which you threw various roots, seeds, bugs, or whatever.
In a more stable situation, other than overnight stops during a journey,
the one step further, and a method of preservation a thousand times more
valuable, was to make the jerked meat into pemmican. This is done very
simply by pounding the dried meat, shredding it apart, and mixing it with
fats. This is the ultimate in trail food. On it alone, one can live.
The suet fats of animals are simmered. The pure fat will rise to the top.
Here you want to use the hard fat from animals such as deer, buffalo, or
beef. The resulting product is tallow (using pork, raccoon, bear, and similar
critters produces lard, which is too soft). The prepared jerky is mixed with
the tallow and you have the complete meal. This can be, and was, kept
in rawhide containers, with all edges sealed with tallow (to ensure that
moisture was kept from the meat). It too is forever preserved.
Just be cautious to have the tallow "not hot" when mixing with
meat. I like it just shy of setting up—still pourable. If set up too much, it
will be difficult to completely cover or coat all the meat. The addition of
dried berries and so on will add a better flavor to the greasy meat, as well
as carbohydrates.
Chapter 5: Makin' Meat - 2 177
If you use hot tallow, it will cook the meat, which
can lead to spoilage and POSSIBLY DEATH!

Chapter 6
Deer from Field to Freezer
Say you've shot your deer, or killed it with a bow and arrow or brought it
down with some other tool. What next!?
The quality of wild game (or even domesticated) meats begins right
here. The first thing that you have to do is to remove the insides. The longer
that these remain in the carcass, the more chance there is for spoilage. Once
a critter dies, it immediately begins to spoil. We have to stop this action if we
want the meat to taste anything like decent.
If an animal's properly shot in the first place (in head, neck, or chest
cavity), the removal of the insides is a fairly clean job. With a gut-shot
animal, the procedures shown still apply but the job won't be very pleasant.
Removal of the guts not only keeps any extra, adverse tastes from
entering the meat but, more important, it begins cooling the carcass, which
will slow down the decaying process, though only temporarily.
Cooling the carcass is my first action. I do this by immediately field-dressing
the game. Then, especially if the weather is warm, by removing the skin from the
animal. With deer this is vitally important, as their hollow hair acts as an
insulation that keeps heat from leaving the carcass. Virtually the only time
that I refrain from immediately removing the skin is when the temperature dips
well below freezing and I really don't want the carcass to freeze.
Some people "hang" their animal for periods ranging from a few days
for up to two weeks. We do this, too, if the weather permits. I feel that
hanging has nothing to do with the taste of the meat. What happens,
Chapter 6: Deer from field to freezer 181
I think, is that the meat fibers are allowed to "relax," somewhat acting as a
tenderizer, especially good for big old bucks. But for this to be successful,
the temperature needs to be approximately 38° to 40°F. If warmer, the meat
will begin to rot, and if frozen it'll do no good.
Most all people intentionally in the wilderness will have with them a
knife of sorts. Many people have with them too much knife. A deer can be
field-dressed or skinned and cut up by using nothing more that a fingernail
file. I'll illustrate here the entire process, using not a fingernail file but a few
stone blades that we knocked from a piece of local chert. I do this to show
that if we can do the complete process using nothing but a piece of stone,
you certainly can do it using any or all the modern tools available to you.
The basic principles shown here can also apply to just about any other
animal, from squirrel to buffalo.
Field Dressing
Here we have a nice doe—shot not more than a few minutes ago, in the chest.
If possible, I like to place the animal on an incline, head down, so that gravity
pushes the guts out of the way while I work. Note that the hind legs have already
been partially skinned for attachment of the tag, from the fish and game
department, through the hind tendons. Laid out are several stone blades. The
round rocks are for resharpening if necessary. The bone knives we never did use,
but they would also have worked.
182 Ultimate Guide to Wilderness Living
Our purpose now is to open the animal from one end to the other, from
anus to throat, and remove all that lies in between. You'll soon see that it's
all attached and that "pulling the cord" from either end will remove it all.
Here, we'll pull from the throat back, though just the reverse will do as well.
Place rocks or sticks on either side of the animal to keep it lying upright
on its back.
Chapter 6: Deer from Field to Freezer 183
After having cut through the skin for about 6" to 8" up from the anus, we have cut
here through the meat down to the pelvic bone. You can readily feel the pointed
ridge of the pelvis, which we'll split to free the bowel. Here some people take
a long-bladed "sharp"knife and reach through the anal opening and make a
circular cut to free this. I've always found splitting the bone much easier. We here
illustrate using a sharp-edged rock to do the splitting (a regular hunting knife
will make this much easier). When splitting the bone, force the legs apart and
with just a slight tap of some sort of hammer, on most deer, it will seem to fall
apart. You have to cut in exactly the right spot, on top of the ridge where you can
feel where the bone is "welded" together, otherwise you'll be "cutting" and not
"splitting."You'U also need to cut just slightly through the stomach membrane
right above the pelvis to relieve the tension preventing you from forcing it apart,
taking care not to cut through the innards.
184 Ultimate Guide to Wilderness Living
Many accounts have you tying off the end of the bowel. We just don't
mess with this. If you're careful, nothing will spill out, and if it does it's
nothing but firm pellets that won't have a tendency to contaminate. You do
as you wish.
Once this delicate task has been taken
care of, cut carefully all the way to the
throat. If the animal was placed on an
incline as noted earlier, the guts won't
tend to spill out and thereby get in
your way. If an incline just isn't there,
place wood, rocks, or whatever under
the hind end. You do want to be careful
not to cut into the innards. Normally
I'll first split the skin, then open the
stomach cavity.
Chapter 6: Deer from Field to Freezer 185
You won't be able to open the sternum (breastbone) merely by slicing.
With a steel knife you need to stand over the animal, facing its head, and
thrust upward. All except the biggest and oldest of animals will split this
way. Illustrated here, we split with a sharp-edged stone, then hammer with a
wooden club. Then we cut the animal's throat to free the windpipe. (I don't bleed
my game. Once a deer is dead, its heart stops beating and the blood stops
flowing, unlike a pig, which will spurt blood for many minutes.)
Now, before we begin to take it apart, we need to cut out the
diaphragm, which separates the chest and stomach cavities. Just cut it free
from the walls—no big deal.
186 Ultimate Guide to Wilderness Living
Now we're ready to pull out all the
innards. As mentioned before, you can
pull from either end. Here we show
pulling with the windpipe, using the
knife for most of the way to free it from
along the backbone. At this stage it's
easier to turn the animal sideways on
the incline. With little effort the guts will
fall out.
If there's snow on the ground, I'll now turn the animal over and let it
drain and also cool. Unless the animal has been shot in the guts, the inside
of the carcass will be as clean as it should be. If snow isn't available, I'll rinse
with cold water, first chance I get, to help cool it if the temperature is up.
The animal is now field-dressed.
Chapter 6: Deer from field to freezer 187
Skinning
The next chore is to skin the animal. I was first taught to skin a deer while it
lay on the ground, a technique that works well. The main problem with this
is that it requires constant bending, which is tough on my bad back (maybe
on yours too?). Instead, first split the legs to the center line and then push,
pull, fist, or cut the skin off. First do one side to the backbone, and then roll
the animal over onto the skin already loosened and repeat on the other side.
I hang most all the deer that I skin from the hind legs, kept spread
apart with a stick, after I've first split the skin of the legs up the center to the
already split belly.
After these initial opening cuts, the knife can be put aside. By pulling
and fisting (pulling the skin with one hand while pushing the fist of the
other between skin and carcass), the skin will separate readily from the
carcass, especially if the critter's still warm.

Sinew Removal
If you're following or practicing primitive skills at all, you'll want to save the

Right: Pulling away layer of fat exposing sinew as shiny silver membrane
(tendon) covering loins.
Left: Putting stick (we generally use a dull knife) between sinew and loin meat.
Right: Pulling down with a smooth motion while jiggling the stick to separate
sinew cleanly from the loin.
Chapter 6: Deer from Field to Freezer 193
Left: Using stick to clean strip as much as possible before removal.
Right: Pushing fingers down following sinew strip to separate it from meats,
on both sides.

(cutting it here loses 2" to 3").
Right: Cutting free at the hip where the sinew draws into a cord.

After removing the sinew, the loins are what lie underneath. Removing (left) is
simple. A knife's hardly needed. The loins can simply be pulled loose (though a
knife makes a neater job of it). The tenderloin is the smaller strip of meat lying
against the backbone on the inside (right); this also can be pulled loose, though
again a knife makes it neater.

Primitive Wilderness
Cooking Methods
What's behind the resurgence of interest in primitive living? For Geri
and me, it's a freedom gained from reliance on others—freedom from
dependency. Every person living in this world, or even out of it (in the
space shuttle even now circling the globe and looking down on our
present somewhat-dire condition), is dependent on the Earth for his or her
existence. It don't matter who or where you are, the Earth supplies your
wants and needs (or doesn't, if you're among the unfortunate many).
Geri's thought—that everyone should be compelled to visit a
slaughterhouse at least once during their growing years—is a good one.
It's mind-boggling how many people think that everything just automatically
comes prepackaged.
Like it or not, we are a part of the Earth, not something separate from
it. Face it: We are animals. The only thing that differentiates us from other
animals is our ability to reason, for we are (supposedly) intelligent. If all
man-made things quit at one time, the Earth wouldn't be bothered with
the overpopulation of humans anymore. It seems that many are searching,
realizing the sad situation that we've gotten ourselves into and trying to do
at least a little bit about it. Just knowing the everyday skills explained in this
book can free you from your dependency.
Chapter 7: Primitive Wilderness Cooking Methods 201
This chapter explores various methods of cooking up some of the things
that you've been shown how to catch, with no modern-day pots and pans.
We'll hit several different methods of cooking something up, but remember:
These are only some of the methods that will work. There are certainly many
that you can come up with yourself, with a little experience and a lot of
imagination plus a will to live.
COOK: "to prepare food for eating by heating."
Simple—yeah, really!
For most people today, you take away their pots, pans, electric skillets,
and microwaves, and there would be a problem. But, as with any of the
other primitive living skills, once you think about it (or have it shown to
you), cooking really is easy, even out in the wilds.
In the Coals
Most boys of the outdoors, at least in my day, didn't concern themselves
with a lot of extra "junk" to carry around. Traveling light was the thing. All
we needed was wieners, potatoes, and corn on the cob thrown directly into
the coals, plus some sticks to move them around and get them out when
ready (and also to scrape off some of the excess ashes). We also sometimes
carried a can of beans or stew, and almost always a small pan to heat water,
or to melt snow, for coffee or hot chocolate (remember, Dave?)
So. To throw your meal directly into the coals is the easiest way to cook
up something. A little bit of ashes won't hurt a body, but remember that
ashes make lye, and lye will eat you. So, for safety sake, a little ashes should
go a long way.
Jim Riggs of Oregon, with his students, simply singes the hair off deer
mice over flames and throws them directly into the coals till done "just
right"—they come out crispy, not too mushy on the inside. Nothing wasted
here. They eat the whole thing: a good way to pick up extra vitamins. We
mostly just skin, remove the stomach and intestines, then cook and eat
what's left. But beware of hantavirus!
Please see the cautions on hantavirus pulmonary syndrome
beginning on page 146.
202 Ultimate Guide to Wilderness Living

"Can I swallow now?"—it's really awfully dry (overdone?).
Packing small game and birds in a mud or clay pack works well, also.
Not any old "mud" will work—it needs to be somewhat sticky so that it
doesn't crumble apart on you. Get the pack as airtight as possible so as
to keep all the juices in. This method has a coupla advantages. You don't
need to skin, singe, or pluck the game—it all will stick to the mud and fall
away from the meat when done. You can also pack tubers and veggies all in
the same package. Gutting it is your choice. In a true primitive or survival
204 Ultimate Guide to Wilderness Living
situation, you may elect to eat it all to get the maximum nourishment that's
available (not knowing where your next meal's coming from).
Have you ever cooked corn on the cob directly on the coals at a
barbecue? Just dip the ear in water and it will steam as it cooks. The same
can be done with other edibles, though be a bit choosy when you pick the
greenery to wrap the food in, as flavors will be added to the food. Certain
leaves (oak and walnut) can impart a bitter taste. Certainly avoid poison
ivy, oak, sumac, and their ilk. And a little sage goes a long way. Sometimes
grasses plaited together, or cattail leaves, either green or wetted, will help
protect the outside from burning and also kinda steam the meal.
If you have any type of flour, make a dough by mixing it with water. Pat
the dough thicker if you want it doughy, thinner for crispy. Throw into the
ashes and, presto: You have "ash cakes."

Imagine this romantic scene: a deer, rabbit, or bird skewered onto a stick
that's placed onto two forked sticks and supported over the fire.
But, when you turn the stick, the critter stays in the same position, not
turning with the stick.
How often I've seen that. It's a great way to cook, yet too often I've met
folks who don't know how to keep the meat turning on the stick.
206 Ultimate Guide to Wilderness Living
One simple way: Poke a hole (or two) through the green stick that
skewers the animal. Then run another stick through the animal, the stick,
and back out through the animal again. If you don't have a knife, a sharp
pointed rock or dead sharp piece of wood (preferably hardwood) should
split the green skewer easily enough. With this method you can cook
anything from a mouse to a buffalo.

uprights to hold skewers, so we used rocks. We also placed rocks on skewers to
keep the meals from rotating and falling to lowest balance.

A lot of food from one fire. You normally wouldn't use all methods at once, but for
photos? At top is baked (mud) fish. Right of that is broiled steak. Center is hen
and trout, rotisseried. Left of that are trout and potato baked in oven. At lower
left are ash cake and bread baked on a stick. To right of that are fried potatoes
and grasshoppers. To the extreme right, the gourmets'delight—roasted mouse.
Again, if flour is available, wrap your dough directly onto a stick and
prop it over the coals.
A steak, roast, fish, or bird can also be stuck onto a green stick and
pinned as above. Or you can use two sticks at angles and prop your dinner
over the fire or coals. Turn as necessary.
Another trick (from Harry in Troy, Montana): Fold two thin, pliable
saplings back on themselves and place your fish, or whatever, inside; then
hold or prop it over the fire or coals.
The cooking methods that we've covered up till now are those that
you'd figure out pretty quick if the necessity arose. Some, not all, of what we
hit now will be things that aren't so often or easily figured out by many.
Chapter 7: Primitive Wilderness Cooking Methods 209
Baking
Here we're talking not about cakes and pies, but just the same old stuff that
we've been cooking up till now By making an oven (of sorts), we're freed of
watching quite so carefully what's going on, so as not to burn supper.
About anytime that we build a cooking fire, at one end we build a small
oven of rocks, as flat as we can get them. On those occasions when flat
rocks aren't available, a careful choosing, banging, and placing of round
rocks will make a serviceable oven.
The fire is built. As it burns down, coals are raked into and around and
over the oven. Heat the rocks slowly so that any water that may be inside
the stone has a chance to leave...slowly. Heat too fast and the steam may
leave too fast, as in bang!
We usually build a longish fire (call it a pit fire), with active burning
at one end, coals in the middle, and oven at the other end. Our ovens
are normally only 3" to 4" high and deep by about 6" wide, larger only if
necessary. Smaller ovens are more efficient for small things, such as pieces of
meat, potatoes, tubers, veggies, birds, and dough for what amounts to bread.
We keep coals in front and on top (and sides too, if it works out, though
that's not necessary). In such an oven foods are done as quick as in the oven
at home.
Another easy oven is a dirt-bank type. Dig into the base of a dirt bank.
If it happens to be clay, fine. If not, line with flat rocks. Build your fire inside
and let heat. When it's ready, just scrape out and keep coals or fire at or near
the entrance.
Now, in conjunction with the first of these ovens, you have right at hand
a frying pan: your hot, flat rock that makes the top of the oven. You can fry
about anything here that you can at home (though maybe not over-easy eggs,
without lots of practice and luck!).
One other "oven type" way to cook is also a hole in the ground. Dig a
hole plenty large enough for what you intend to place in it. You'll want some
extra space (note the following photos). There are a lot of variations to this
"pit" cooking. You just pick and choose what works for you.
If the soil is claylike, fire it by building a hot fire within. If the soil is
sandy or crumbly, line it with flat stones.
Build a fire in the prepared hole. I prefer to leave the coals in the hole.
I put a handful of green sticks or twigs directly onto the coals, followed by
210 Ultimate Guide to Wilderness Living
a layer of green or wetted grass, maybe adding some cattail leaves (green)
if available, and then the meal. The green sticks or twigs will add a great
smoke flavoring. The wet or green grasses and cattail leaves add moisture and
also protect the meal from direct contact with the coals. Do remember, though,
that the particular tastes of the leaves and grasses will stay with the meal.
Then in goes the meal: meat, roots, nuts, whatever. Cover the hole with
a flat rock that's been preheated and seal. Place coals on the rock. Now
the food is heated from above and below, with more of a steam heat. Trial
and error will dictate the time. Because of the moist heat, you really can't
overcook. Figure three to five hours for most average-sized meals.
The fact that oxygen can't fuel the fire will keep the thing from bursting
into flames—hence, the importance of covering coals and sealing the hole as
fast as possible.
If a flat rock isn't available, build a supporting layer of sticks at the top
of the pit and cover it with a jacket, shirt, blanket, or grasses (grasses aren't
the best, as they'll leak some dirt). Then proceed to seal this with plenty of
dirt. This will also work better if the dirt has been preheated by building a
fire over it. Because the pit is sealed air-tight, and by taking particular care
to cover the coals with moist greenery, no flames should appear (though
they might).
Now you have several hours to forage or trap or build without having to
tend your meal.

Placing grasses and cattail leaves in hole.
Left: Now in goes the meal and (right) laying the rock lid and sealing all
openings first with grasses and then with dirt. You want it sealed till no smoke is
seen escaping. If air enters, the meal can be burned. We also piled about 6" of
dirt on top to help keep in the heat. Since the rock was already hot clear through,
we didn't build a fire on top, though it can be done.
212 Ultimate Guide to Wilderness Living
The finished meal. Here we let it cook for only 2 1/2 hours because of failing
daylight. Chicken was perfect, just beginning to fall from the bones. The potatoes
were done, but firm.
Boiling
One of the best reasons there is for knowing how to boil something in a
primitive situation (and there are several such reasons) is to make a little bit
go a long way. One smallish piece of meat—say, a rat, a squirrel, a coupla
mice, a bird, even fish—when boiled or roasted will help to fill your belly
faster than eating the critter raw. And to the broth can be added any number
of other nutritious things that you've gathered during the day, such as seeds,
nuts, insects, or edible plants. And though it's not the thing that you'd
normally be able to accomplish on your first night in a primitive situation,
unless you're awfully lucky to find just the right "pot," it also isn't difficult to
come across things that can function as a pot.
What we'll do in this situation is to heat the water using hot rocks—
called, appropriately, hot rock cooking.
Although most rocks will do the job, you do need to be somewhat
Chapter 7: Primitive Wilderness Cooking Methods 213
selective. Some will just crumble (sandstones), but others can and do
explode when heated (flints, cherts, obsidian). You will need to do the
checking if you can't tell the difference. And do be aware of the danger of
exploding rocks. But just a bit of knowledge and common sense will prevent
any mishaps, or at least most.
We assume no responsibility for any injury resulting from
exploding rocks.
We generally prefer "creek rocks," but those not actually found in
creeks. The hard, roundish granite-type stones seem to us to work about
the best. Just pick them from higher ground. Those that have been soaked
in water might have gotten moisture inside through tiny cracks; when
the rock is heated, the water can't get out slowly enough for the crack to
accommodate—and so, bang.
We've used soft limestone. It heats well but eventually breaks apart (as
do all rocks that I've used). Softer rocks also have the tendency to leave a
grit in the soup or stew, though that may help to keep your insides reamed
out. Pumice or lava rock is a good choice.
Heat the rocks. It's best to build a good, solid foundation of wood on
which to build your fire. Reason: All rocks eventually fall into the deepest
part of the fire, which may not be the hottest if it happens to be only the
ground. Layer wood and rocks. We generally use about a dozen rocks to
heat a gallon of water (more or less), as the temperature of the water from
a mountain stream is usually awfully cold. As the first rocks are taken from
under the water as they cool, place them in a section of "new" fire. When
you run out of rocks the first time through and you're not done cooking, the
first ones used will have heated again and be ready to go. The second section
of fire also helps to distinguish which rocks are which.
The pot: We've often used a fresh deerskin for our pot. Either set it into
a hole in the ground and stake it around, or tie it into a tripod of sticks.
Usually the hair's left on. We generally cook this way when demonstrating
brain tanning, and we use the freshly fleshed (say that 10 times fast!) skin,
hair side out of course. You don't need to flesh the skin, as the flesh and fats
will add to the meal. The skin will shrink considerably as it also cooks, so
take this into account or you'll have broth all over the place. We normally
214 Ultimate Guide to Wilderness Living
leave lots of slack in the skin when cooking in a hole. Tied to a tripod, it'll
just shrink, so don't fill it as full. You'll hafta feel this out.
A larger animal's stomach can be, and has been, used also. Here you
have the added advantage of being able to eat the pot.
A depression large enough in a rock would be great, as long as it's
convenient for and to camp.
A solid piece of wood will work fine, though it will take some time to
hollow it out (it's easiest done with fire). In a semipermanent camp, this
would be no problem.
A clay pot is the cat's meow. This could also be just placed into the fire.
(See Chapter 9 for more details on primitive pottery.)
A tightly coiled basket will work as a pot. I've always thought that such
baskets needed to be lined with pitch, but have been shown otherwise by
those who know.
A hole dug in the ground (ground that wouldn't leak) would surely
work. So much the better if the ground happened to be clayish. Build a fire
in it first, and you've got a nonmovable pot.
Now, let's get cooking.
When we first started hot rock cooking, we just used forked sticks and
placed the hot rocks directly into the skin pot. By carefully removing the
rocks from the pot, we were able to get two or three meals out of one skin.
Finally, a hole would appear in the weakened skin, and our supper (the
broth, anyhow) literally went down the drain.
We now make a small basket or carrier to put the rocks into and then
place that in the pot. This is much easier on the pot. You can sometimes
place three or four rocks into the carrier. It's best to have the carrier in
the soup before putting the hot rocks in, as they have a tendency to burn
through the cordage holding it together, since the rocks are red hot, or near
to it.
The following photos show the tools we normally use, but remember,
forked sticks alone will do.
Chapter 7: Primitive Wilderness Cooking Methods 215
Tools handy for hot rock cooking. Two types of "tongs" (top and bottom)
and a basket to hold the rocks while immersing into the skin pot. This saves wear
and tear on the pot when taking rocks out. Simple forked sticks can be used in
lieu of tongs.

I know that cooked meat can poison you if it spoils, and the rawhide
pot does cook. I don't know how to judge this, but common sense should
dictate here, so don't let the "cooked" pot get too old.
It normally takes from 5 to 10 fist-sized rocks, red hot, to bring the
water to a boil. Remember, this is usually mountain creek water, which is
mighty cold! Figure about 10 minutes or less. Once boiling, it only takes
one or two rocks in the basket at a time to keep the brew simmering for
3 to 5 minutes. When these are first placed in the brew it'll boil like a hot
springs, and then settle down to a simmer. You can hear the rocks cooking
and sizzling. When it slows down, take the rocks out and replace with new
ones. You'll be cooking as fast as you would on a stove. In fact, the water
will boil hotter at higher elevations and so cook faster. I know of one fellow
who does all his camp boiling with hot rocks (in a Dutch oven) while in the
mountains just because it does cook faster. And if you saw the size of this
guy, you'd know why he wanted or needed his food faster!

Chaptei 7: Primitive Wilderness Cooking Methods 217
Using "tongs" to place hot rocks into basket, in the water to help keep burning
through the basket.
After several rocks (in this case, about 10) are placed in the water, it comes
quickly to a rolling boil and will simmer for 3 to 5 minutes.
I'll touch on one other method to (kinda) boil things. For quite some
time we've used dehaired deer rawhide for water buckets. I've seen water
boiled in a paper cup that's placed directly into a fire. Take note that paper
and deer rawhide aren't the same.
The pot or bucket at first will leak readily. After some soaking (from
a few to several hours), it somehow seals itself. One bucket that we've
carried for over a year and always fill with water at workshops and demos
doesn't "leak" at all, though water does filter through and evaporate (thereby
keeping the contents cool).
Well, one summer we carried around a pot of deer rawhide—a nice skin,
too—with the intention of cooking in it. We did. First we got lots of coals
but little flame. Our pot is held together by natural fiber cordage, and several
times flames were licking close. It was a hassle. And the skin kept springing
leaks (dripping): no rhyme or reason, just when and wherever they felt like
it. And then they'd quit. Not enough to put the fire out (just drips), but a real
pain. It kept the fire cool. We worked for about two hours and never did get
the damn thing to boil. It did simmer, and would have cooked after the first
15 or 20 minutes or so. But boil—no. It also shrank to almost half its original
size. We had to constantly dip water out. Hot rocks work much better.

Primitive Wilderness
Containers
No hunters or gatherers are worth their salt without something to put their
gatherings in. As with most other aspects of primitive living, assembling a
suitable container is actually much easier than you might at first suspect,
what with all the cumulative knowledge that you've gained in reading about
other aspects of primitive living in the other chapters. The importance of
some suitable container can't be stressed enough—it really does make life
easier. Remember, you're going "naked into the wilderness," and you've got
no pockets.
I designed this chapter to show you a lot of photos with some
descriptive and explanatory words. I figure that the photos pretty well
speak for themselves. This material, however, is far from the final word on
containers. Instead, what you'll encounter here are several types that have
worked for Geri and me and that are primarily functional, with little or
no artwork. There are many, many ideas that will work as well but that we
haven't covered, due not only to lack of space but also to our own lack of
knowledge. We do show workable products, and—most importantly—we
explain the characteristics that you need to look for to get the job done in
your own region of the country.
Chapter 8: Primitive Wilderness Containers 221
Baskets
The first container that comes to mind to most folks would be a basket.
Here we'll show you three methods to obtain some sort of basket. While the
instructions in this chapter will be far from definitive answers to your every
question on basketry, they do offer three ways that work well to give you a
finished product. You don't need to stick to any one of these methods but
can mix and match, as you will and as the circumstances dictate. To all you
artists in basketry out there, please bear with us and remember that these
are functional.
Materials
As will be shown, many things in nature work well in basketry. You only
need to search out particular characteristics—mainly that a material is
pliable, or can be made to be. It helps if it'll remain a bit pliable after the
project has been completed so that it won't fall apart in use. The purpose of
the basket will help to dictate this. If it's to be used only for gathering nuts
(the ones growing on trees, not those living in them) or herbs, a lighter-duty
basket will suffice. If your goal is to gather heavy-duty rocks or whatever
(and remember, we cavemen do need our rocks!), then a brittle basket will
be wasted. The longer the material is, the less splicing will be necessary to
create a basket.
Stick baskets—as I refer to those made of, well, sticks—can and should
be made more pliable by soaking for several hours or days, depending on
the material. We mostly use dogwood and willow for these. You can use the
information in this chapter as a guide, but do search out your area to find
what it has to offer, and then maybe experiment or temporize. As you'll see,
many other materials can be and are used—cattails; any cordage; some
vines, barks, and grasses. As we approach these various materials herein,
we'll explain how to prepare them.
Warps, Wefts, and Woofs
These are what your baskets are composed of. Warps are the longitudinal
threads, sticks, or cords into which the wefts (also known as woofs) are
threaded. This is a simple definition, and in practice the actual basket is
sometimes not so simply accomplished.
222 Ultimate Guide to Wilderness Living

has been added (lower center, arrow).
As we proceed, you'll find that warps
will be added as necessary for strength.

last of the old; the lower arrow points to

the warps have been threaded down

Bottom: The finished product.
Chapter 8: Primitive Wilderness Containers 223
Twining
In twining, you're working with two wefts. Normally you twist these once,
between warps.
With this basket (actually, here a bag), shown in the process of being
made, we're using cattails exclusively as the material. These were cut dead
in winter, and allowed to dry (cattails grow where it's wet), and resoaked,
then corded for the warps. The cording allows for a stronger basket or bag.
(Cording is taught in detail in Chapter 1.) Then a single piece of cattail, wet,
was twined in.
This bag, also twined, has been made from a variety of materials. Elm bark was
corded for the warps, while the bottom coupla inches was single-strand elm
bark, followed by a few inches of western dogbane, followed by several more
inches of eastern dogbane (not corded; the fibers only cleaned and then twined
in). The whole was finished at the top with several inches of grass—what we call
slough grass, since it grows in wet areas, and what others call reed canary grass.
The strap is brain-tanned deerskin (finished according to methods given in
Chapter 10).
This burden basket, appropriately
named, is made mostly from dogwood,
with a bit of willow tossed in. Deer
rawhide supports the basket, to which
is tied a tumpline (pack strap) of braintanned
deerskin. The tumpline goes
around the shoulders or the head when
carrying, leaving the hands free.
224 Ultimate Guide to Wilderness Living
Baske t Weave
To basket weave means, of course, to weave a basket.
There are many ways in which you can begin your warps (your up and
downers). This step is almost always the most difficult. You'll never have
nearly enough hands for this operation. Sticks are always wanting to fall
apart here. Just persevere and it'll work.
Now, when basket weaving, you need to have an odd number of warps,
for the weaving to work out. With twining it makes no difference.
Note the addition of a 13th warp
in the upper left.

it.,
Geri did most all the basket work
illustrated on these pages. She simply
laid 3 shoots (of willow) on 3 others
(making for 12 warps). She then
made several wraps using the basket weave, which is simply one over and the
next under the warp. Then she stuck another shoot in, in order to make an odd
number, and from here on out the basket weave achieves its purpose, alternating
one above and one below on each full turn. After only a few wraps she decided
to bend the shoots upward, to make for a more cylindrical basket.

the one-strand basket weave, changing to a two-strand twining (right).

You'll have to closely study all the following photos, remembering that starting
is the hardest part of all. Here we're using only slough grass and tying it together
with yucca fibers, though almost any cordage-type material would suffice.

Bark Container
In the field, you can use bark in a surprising number of ways. The one
that interests us here is the making of containers. Using bark is one of the
quickest means of making a finished container. What we illustrate in the
photos is working with eastern red cedar. The first priority in selecting bark
is that it easily separates from the tree. The second is that it isn't so fragile
and brittle that it'll self-destruct. Most of us know that birch bark works for
any number of containers, including the famous canoe of poems and stories.
The first "other" bark container that I was presented with was made of
juniper (one of which is illustrated later). Another useful bark is that of the
tulip poplar. Many species of elm work well. Experiment.
Since the photos are self-explanatory, I'll list here the more important
aspects to be aware of. You'll note that any holes are drilled into the bark,
not cut. The bark really wants to split, so care must be taken. When the
container's finished, place it over an object that will force it to keep its shape
as it dries. Here we used a log.
Also note that in the two photos where Geri ties the container together,
each is done differently. One uses a series of holes with cordage run through
in such a way that there's a hole for the cord to run through, and also the
cord runs around the container. In the other photo, there's only a single tie
at the top and the rest is held together with cord. The pointed sides of the
bottoms make it easy to tie the cordage off there, adding more strength.

Cordage
We covered cordage in depth in Chapter 1, so we won't go into it again here
except to note that, though not necessarily a "container," cordage can sure
haul a lot of stuff on a gathering expedition. In many circumstances, it can
also be made on the spot.

Stone Container
Some stones are soft enough to work with. The accompanying photos show
soapstone being used to create containers. This material works super easily
and was used extensively in days of old, where it was available.

which can be harmful to your health.

We've also used limestone for containers (our Kentucky limestone, not
what's found in the Southeast). Though it can be used for hot rock cooking,
it won't withstand the higher temperature of being placed directly into the fire.
Animal Parts Used as Containers
The animal kingdom sure does provide us with an abundance of spare parts,
many of which we can use as containers. Our ancestors did it, and so can
you. Here we'll delve into several of them, beginning with the outside.
Rawhide—Such a variety of containers can be made from the raw hide
of the animal that it staggers the imagination.

traditionally two to a hide.
Right: A container made from the raw skin of a deer, leaving

Parfletche—This was the Plains Indians' suitcase. All types of
containers can be made from a heavy hide: round, square, rectangular, whathave-you.
They can be held together in any number of ways, such as by
sewing, tying, or gluing, or in combination. But rawhide becomes an oozing
mass when wetted, so you must take care to waterproof anything made from
it, or otherwise protect it from moisture. We size (varnish) our products
with the juice of the prickly pear. Several other waterproofing options are
available that we won't cover in this book.
A container that can be used for several purposes. It's simply rawhide of a deer,
laced to a wooden frame. Most obviously, this could be used for water or hot rock
cooking (see Chapter 7).

Finished-out buckskin makes for many swell containers. Illustrated is a typical
Northern Plains bow case and quiver.
Wood Container
Most containers made of wood are associated with bowls for eating, or as
dippers or buckets. In most cases, a container of one piece of wood is too
heavy or is prone to break, or both. Canoes, consisting of dug-out logs,
would be an exception.
A solid, dry piece of a softwood can be chipped, carved, or burned
out to make most of the above items. One caution, though, when burning:
If moisture remains in the wood, the high temperature of the burning coal
can cause the expanding steam to crack the wood.

Now, here's something a bit different. Many woods, especially soft
cottonwood logs, when left out to weather, rot from the inside out.

still reasonably hard.

Now you've seen many and varied means to obtain or make containers
in the wilds. More important, you possess the knowledge of just what to
look for when you want to go a-gatherin'. Knowing and understanding the
principles and characteristics of what you're doing and looking for is vastly
more important than knowing only how one or two methods or materials
work—and much better than having any kit.

Chapter 9
Primitive Pottery
This chapter certainly is not a definitive work on primitive pottery. What it
will do is give you some ideas and techniques for going out, digging up some
dirt (clay), and turning it into a usable container or vessel to make your
wilderness living or survival more bearable.
As always when trying new things, expect some failures. (Along our
journeys, we had a great many, but lived to tell about it!) This material
contains a lot of variables, though if you understand the principles and
follow the rules, success will follow—for many people, this will happen on
the very first try.
Quick Run-Through
Simply, you need to:
^ Find a source of clay.
& Dig it up.
# Wet it, if dry.
# Clean it.
Form it into a shape (a bowl, in our example here).
Hfc Let it dry.
At this stage, it can be used under limited and controlled circumstances.
It will be very brittle and will dissolve if wetted. Clay, when mixed with straw
and baked in the sun, can be and has been used over millennia to make
bricks (adobe). Bowls can be used for dry storage. But for most practical
Chapter 9: Primitive Pottery 247
applications the item must now be fired. Only fire will transform the watersoluble
clay into a material that will enable you to use the bowl, not only to
store water but also to boil it.
It really is about that simple. Let's cover the above steps, maybe
amplifying and adding one or two others as we go.
Clay
Without getting technical, clay is a type of soil that (1) when moist becomes
plastic (that is, moldable); (2) dries hard, retaining its molded shape; and (3)
will change characteristics when fired, so that it won't dissolve once again
when wetted. Firing allows a clay bowl, for example, to be used as a cooking
and storage vessel, and lets you create lots of other utilitarian as well as fun
things, both cheaply and quickly.
Most everyone knows what clay is. You just have to find some. It really
is a rather abundant earth material. You'll most often and easily find clay
deposits along stream banks, next to ponds, and in road cuts.
248 Ultimate Guide to Wilderness Living
Before wetting dry clay, it's best to first pound or grind it into smaller pieces.
The more approved method of cleaning: making into a slurry (left),
then pouring off the thinner clay (right), leaving any stones to sink to the bottom.
If your clay is wet when found, you've saved a step and some time.
Just dig back into the vein a bit to get away from surface debris (this will
only have to be removed), then dig up the clay and put it into a vessel of
some sort for carrying.
Chapter 9: Primitive Pottery 249
If the clay you've found is dry, it needs to be rewetted. There are lots of
ways to do this.
What most "good" potters do is to pound or grind up the clay before
adding water (to allow for better absorption). They then add enough water
to completely dissolve the particles and to make a "slurry" solution. You
want it kinda thin—the purpose being to allow you to stir the solution
well. Let it set for 20 to 30 seconds (allowing the heavier stones and so on
to settle), and then carefully pour off the thinner, silty clay solution into
another container. This can be repeated if necessary. Once almost all the
impurities seem to be removed, set the container aside, allowing the heavier
clay to settle and occasionally pouring off the lighter water. This can take
several days. As the clay begins to thicken, you can spread it out on a
smooth surface to speed the drying. When it reaches the right consistency,
it's ready to use.
As the mixture is allowed to set, the clay settles and the water can be poured off.
Using a rawhide container speeded this process, as moisture could evaporate
through the skin.
Further drying is expedited by
"pancaking" the clay.
250 Ultimate Guide to Wilderness Living
Often when we're in a hurry to make a bowl (I'm always in a hurry, it
seems!), we just mix water and clay, kneading and working it till it's "right,"
feeling the larger impurities and removing them with our fingers. This works
well especially with smaller, quickie bowls when you're rushed. But it's
believed that the longer the clay sits wet, the better it will be to work with.
For working, the moisture content must be just right. Too wet, and it'll
be too sticky and will slump, not holding its shape. Too dry, and it will crack
as you work it. If a little too wet, it can either be spread out to dry some
or just worked in your hands, allowing the sun and breeze to dry it. This
additional working is good for the clay, most notably for removing pockets
of air. If the clay is only a bit dry, what works well is to dip your hands in
water, shake off the excess, and then work the clay.
Not all clays will work in making containers, owing to their chemical
compounds.
A good, simple test is to roll a handful of clay pencil-thin and tie it
into a knot. If it doesn't break or crack, it's a good candidate. Plasticity is
the key here.
The amount of shrinkage during drying is also an important factor.
Too much can hurt. The addition of temper (see that section below) can
sometimes help.
One clay that we've worked with a lot was touted by all who touched
and worked with it as having a "great feel." Well, we've never yet gotten a
good firing out of it. This was a clay that had all the outward characteristics
of a good, usable clay—pliability, shrinkage, feel—but it just wouldn't hold
up to firing. It blew apart.
So, if you follow all instructions and still have firing problems, change clays.
Chapter 9: Primitive Pottery 251
Clay with just enough moisture to wet. Let set for a short time and then work well
with your hands, picking and cleaning.
An easy test to check for pliability.
Temper
To potters, temper means to mix (clay) with water or a modifier (such as
grog). Grog is a collective term for refractory (resistant to heat) materials,
such as crushed pottery and firebricks, used to make refractory products (as
crucibles) that reduce shrinkage in drying and firing.
First we clean the clay of rubble. Then do we add more rubble to the clay?
We had a lot of questioning to do on this one, and found no single
answer. Most consultants we spoke with agreed on several points, though
none gave us a firm definition. Many admitted that they had no idea exactly
what was happening here. Several had theories.
252 Ultimate Guide to Wilderness Living
I'll list here what we've noted from others, and what we've also come up
with ourselves:
^ The temper (grog) is a stable.
^ The clay is not.
& A lot of rubble (stones and so forth) in the fresh-dug clay is not
a stable, so it needs to be removed.
^ During drying, and especially during firing, the clay will shrink and
expand to a certain degree. Here, a little goes a long way—too much
action and the pot cracks or breaks. The temper helps to keep the
vessel (clay) more stable during these periods.
4> Some clays don't require temper. Others might need up to a one-third
addition. As noted earlier, each clay has its own special properties.
^ Small pots require less temper than larger ones, or sometimes none.
Large pots tend to slump when building, but the addition of temper
helps to counteract this.
& The intended use of the finished product has some bearing.
Vessels that will be in and out of the fire (each time experiencing
expansion and contraction) will require more temper than those
used primarily for storage.
^ The addition of temper actually weakens the pot. More and coarser temper
should be added to cooking vessels, as it takes the heat shock better.
Geri thinks of temper as being the main ingredient and of clay as just
holding it together—kinda like working cement. Steve Watts opines that, on
a microscopic level, pottery begins to break down as soon as you start to use
it. Minuscule cracks develop every time that the pot is heated or cooled. He
strongly feels that the temper acts as a stopping point for these cracks, like
drilling a hole in a windshield at the end of a crack to stop its progress.
Now that we've got some idea of just what temper is and the purpose
thereof, what do we use as temper?
Sand and grit are usually readily available for temper purposes.
But beware of what makes up the sand in your area. Where we live there
must be some limestone in it, and our limestone isn't stable. Every time that
we've used it, the pots have blown in firing. By contrast, limestone in the
southeastern United States is different, and works.
Chapter 9: Primitive Pottery 253
Grass, dried cow dung, and other organic materials can be used.
Broken, fired pottery (shards), when crushed fine, can be reused.
Shell is often good. Most (perhaps all) shell will work. We've used
freshwater mussel successfully. One caution, though: Fire or burn the shell
first. Unfired shell isn't stable. The initial expansion when being fired is more
than in clay, and firing stabilizes it. We've had some shell material, after
"cooking" and firing, absorb moisture and swell in the pot, thereby breaking.
This list should cover most circumstances, so now let's put it all together
and make something we can use in a wilderness situation.
Sand.
Left: Mussel shells being fired.
Right: The fired shell crumbles and is now stable.
Construction
Mix the temper and clay to the desired proportions, then don't stop: Keep
on working it. It can't be worked too much. Slam it. Beat it. Work it in your
hands or on a hard surface. Compress everything well, and remove any
and all air pockets. If a bit wet, work it till it dries just right. If dry, wet it
by dipping your fingers in water. Once the "right" wetness is achieved, I find
myself constantly rewetting by dipping fingers to keep it just right.
At some point, take a baseball-sized hunk of the mixture and work with
that. Work it...work it...wor k it.
After several minutes, take the ball of clay and begin forcing your fist or
fingers into it to develop a hollow—this is the beginning of the pot. Keep the
forming pot moving in a circular fashion on the fist, meanwhile constantly
beating, tapping, compressing the walls. Work out any cracks. Just keep
working it—you'll begin to "feel" the clay.
Start "pulling" clay from the bottom up toward the top. Put your fingers
against the inside walls of the pot and pat the outside opposite to further
compress. (Here some folks use a smooth stone on the inside and a wooden
"paddle" on the outside. The paddle's usually wrapped with cordage to help
prevent sticking. The technique is called, appropriately, "paddling.") All air
pockets need to be worked out, as they can explode in firing.
In not too many minutes you'll find yourself with a smallish bowl
literally on your hands.
Chapter 9: Primitive Pottery 255
At this point I'll run my slightly dampened fingers over the whole pot,
inside and out, smoothing and compressing, all the while being careful not
to get it too wet.
Now, if you have the pot the size that you want it (cereal-bowl size?),
set it on a piece of bark or whatever's handy (making it easier to move
around) and set it in the shade to dry slowly. Fast drying will have the
tendency to crack the product. It will now take from a coupla days to a
coupla weeks, depending on conditions, of slow drying. Keep it protected.
All moisture needs to escape. It must be bone dry.
To repeat my caution: Any moisture left in the clay
will explode in firing.
Temper added to clay.
Mix well ...beat..
256 Ultimate Guide to Wilderness Living

Pat to compress and then pull the clay up.
If you have too much clay, pinch a little off and continue to form.
Pinching, patting...
258 Ultimate Guide to Wilderness Living

Now, if you want to create a larger pot, form it this way as big as you
can before slumping occurs. When you reach a certain height, the pot will
begin to sag or slump because of its own weight. You now have to let the
main body of the pot dry somewhat before adding more weight, but you also
need to keep the rim wet so that more clay can be "welded" to it.
Set the pot in the shade. Wet the rim with damp fingers, and cover with
green leaves or something similar to keep the rim from drying too much as
the body dries. This may take only an hour or so, or maybe overnight.
When the pot's ready for the addition of more clay, roll out a coil of
prepared clay (called "coiling"), the same thickness as the pot walls (less
than 1/4" and up to 1/2").
This now can be added to the pot. Be careful not to add too much
weight at once. You may be able to apply more than one coil at a time.
Just don't get too rushed. Use your fingernail or a tool of bone or wood or
something else, to "draw" the coils together, both inside and out. Squeeze
and compress it all together to weld into one. In this manner, you can build
the pot about as large as you desire.
If you wish it larger, roll out a coil and add it on.
260 Ultimate Guide to Wilderness Living
Pinch, compress, and pull it together.
Cover the fresh added clay with wet
leaves to keep the rim from drying as
the rest of the pot does.
When you're satisfied, set the pot aside, as you did with the smaller pot.
It needs to be bone dry—but it must dry slowly. As mentioned earlier, this
may take up to two weeks.
Well, not all rules are set in clay, so to speak. Maria-Louise Sidoroff
made a large vessel one time, beginning with fresh clay in the morning
and firing it that evening. She speeded up the drying process by rotating it
around a fire. It worked! On several occasions while in the field we've dug
clay and built pots one day, dried them (controlled) by the fire the next day,
and fired them on the second or third day.
After a day or so, under most circumstances, the pots can be handled.
We usually turn the pots upside down at some stage in the drying to allow
the bottom to dry well.
Chapter 9: Primitive Pottery 261
If you'd like to decorate the pot (perhaps using cordage marks from
a paddle, or rolling a corn cob over it), this should be done before drying.
When the pot's still fresh, or after the initial drying of a day or so called
"leather dry", lines can be etched into it. This can be done when dry but
seems to work better at the leather-dry stage.
Leather dry is also the stage to thin the pot, if you wish, by gently
scraping away thicker areas, using a piece of bone, stone, or shell.
A very smooth pebble or a piece of bone can be used to smooth and
burnish the pot. This is a good idea for the inside of a pot designed for
cooking or eating. This can be done at the leather-dry or dry stage.
So what do we have up till now? We've found a source of clay, dug it,
cleaned it, dirtied it (added temper), carefully made a pot, designed it, and
slowly dried it.
Still one more major step to go, and that's next.
If you want to use a bowl for food or drink, sanitize it by burnishing the inside
with a smooth stone.
262 Ultimate Guide to Wilderness Living
Burnish the outside, if desired, for decoration.
Firing
The last step in your pot making is the firing. What you've read in earlier
sections concentrated all your efforts on building and drying. You were
left to assume that if the pot made it through these stages, you had it
made—wrong!
By just slapping some clay around, you can have success up to this
stage, but you'll lose many pots through careless firing. Care must be taken!
In primitive firing (meaning without sophisticated equipment and
gas-fired kilns), lots can go wrong, and the pots are highly susceptible to
breakage at this stage. Some old-time primitive potters speak of a failure rate
of up to 50 percent.
Actually, we should refer to the firing in two stages, the prefiring and
the firing.
As the pot heats, it will expand, and any remaining moisture (not all
of it leaves in the previous drying) has to be driven out, slowly. So we
want to proceed slowly. Gradual heating throughout. So we preheat.
Then the pot must be transferred from indirect heat to direct heat.
We lose a lot of them here.
Two other critical stages are, first, when the pot reaches a temperature
of around the boiling point (212°F) and the remaining unnatural water
leaves and, second, when the pot reaches a temperature of 800° to 900°F
Chapter 9: Primitive Pottery
and the natural chemical water of the clay is burned out. After this second
stage, the clay can't be returned to its original condition and be reworked.
When firing your pots, avoid windy or rain-threatening days. A cool
draft or even a drop of rain can ruin your efforts.
Let's list some firing techniques and tips.
Firing Method # 1
A simple method for firing an individual pot, which produces varying
results, we once saw done by Evard Gibby of Idaho.
He simply scrapes a wide depression in the ground an inch or so deep
and a coupla feet in diameter. In there he puts some small rocks, on which
to place the overturned pot. Then he sets a length of cordwood about the
same diameter as the pot is high on either side of it, leaving a small space
between log and pot. Then he places two more pieces of same-sized wood
between the ends of the first two, up to and almost touching the pot. Next
he crumbles cow chips (dried manure) to cover the pot and then covers it
all with smaller pieces of wood. Finally, he builds a larger pile of wood (tipi
shaped) over this, and lets the whole thing burn. He takes care to let the pot
cool slowly.
We've done some firings like this in the past, and have had varying
success with our own clay.
Surrounding with logs (left) and covering with dried cow manure (right).
264 Ultimate Guide to Wilderness Living
Covering with more sticks and building into a tipi fire.
That's it. One step (no preheating). We can vouch for the fact that it's
successful, for small pots at least.
In other firing methods, the pot must first be preheated.
Firing Method # 2
Some people build a circular fire around pots and gradually move the fire in
till finally the pots are actually resting in the fire itself. They eventually build
the fire up with larger pieces of wood and let it burn for a coupla hours.
Or, instead of using large pieces of wood, they constantly replenish it with
smaller twigs spaced around, between, and above the pots.
Preheat.
266 Ultimate Guide to Wilderness Living
Cet it doser, higher, and hotter—finally, build it over.
Firing Method # 3
Another method is to build a fire and to move the pot (or pots) closer,
turning and rotating them till well preheated, then scraping the fire away
and laying the pots in the coals or ashes or on an insulated layer of
preheated rocks or old pottery shards. Let the pots sit a short time to
allow gradual heating up before adding more fire.
Firing Method # 4
From Steve Watts comes a technique for "firing the Catawba way," as he
calls it. Preheat. Set on coals for a bit, then add pine needles, and so forth,
to make for a slow heating. Then begin adding small woods, and then finally
larger woods. When burned to coals, rebuild. Do twice for small pots.
Three times for larger ones.
Chapter 9: Primitive Pottery 267
Firing Method # 5
Over the years we've settled on one method that gives us 100 percent
success...most times. We came to this through trial and error, because the
clay that we've had the most success with here is touchy and fails when we
fire using other methods. It's pretty much the same as a method described
earlier, with a few changes. To make a fire in a ring, the easiest way we've
found is by first building a fire to preheat the ground and then, when it burns
down, raking the coals and small embers out into the size circle needed.
Building a circle fire is next to impossible. But making a circle fire as
described is easy! Once circled, place small, stable (unblowupable: my word)
stones or pieces of brick to put the pots on, place the pots on the stones (we
almost always place them top down to keep hot coals from failing inside and
adding too much heat too soon), and build up the ring of fire. Keep enough
distance from fire to nearest pots so that you don't heat too fast, with more
distance on the upwind side. Keep the fire alive and move it slowly toward
the pots, ensuring that the heating is gradual. More and bigger fire. Closer
and closer.
When a few inches from the fire's actually touching the pots (remember,
upwind will be a longer distance), build the fire high enough so that long
sticks can be placed on top of the fire to make a roof a few inches above
the pots. Things go fast at this point. What you're doing is almost making a
kiln with the fire. The cooler air from outside the ring will sweep the flames
and heat into the center and up. You must keep the actual flames from most
direct contact with the pots (for now), but much heat is applied.
Finally, you're putting a roof over it all, which will create more heat
from above. We've found that this method makes for a more-even heating of
the pots at a critical stage, allowing them to get a lot hotter before having the
flames totally consume them. It takes about 1 1/2 to 2 hours, on a perfect
day with no excess winds, and a whole lot of wood, resulting in a close to
100 percent success rate.
One disadvantage in placing the pots upside down is that, if there's
any moisture in the ground, the steam created will rise into the pots with
nowhere to go. This can cause cracks and possibly breakage.
268 Ultimate Guide to Wilderness Living
Firing Method # 6
One more firing method, which we haven't found in common use in the
States, is the use of a primitive kiln (hardening oven). This gives you more
control in heating gradually. Simply, the kiln is dug into a hillside, with
a firing chamber below it. The heat and smoke from the fire is tunneled
through the kiln. The ancient Chinese used this extensively, often stairstepping
kilns up a hillside, heating from a single fire chamber. You must
ensure that the firing chamber is of sufficient size to heat the kiln to the
required temperature (1200° to 1600°F; the color will be from dark red at the
lower temperature through cherry red, bright cherry red, and orange at the
higher temperature). This temperature should be maintained for two to four
hours. The chimney escape should ideally be through the bottom of the kiln
(so as to retain as much heat as possible—heat rises, remember?) and then
up (see drawing on next page). The opening needs to be large enough to
allow sufficient draw for the fire to reach the high temperatures required.
I think that this shows you that firing pottery just ain't throwing pots
into the fire—though it's not all that difficult, either.
Last Words
Pots are made to use, so use 'em. The final test is to cook in them.
Try to remember the word "gradual." Cold water in a hot pot can be
disastrous. Same vice versa. Heat with coals or small flames.
When handling hot pots, use leather pot holders or wooden "tongs."
Cloth can burst into flames.
Avoid lifting a pot by its rim, as you just might break it off.
Advice from Maria-Louise Sidoroff, whose expertise in making and
using primitive pottery is known internationally: "A well constructed and
sound pot will get better with usage. Using ordinary precautions, the life
expectancy would be many, many years."
Chapter 9: Primitive Pottery 269
# Kiln can be lined with rocks.
# Pote should be set on rock pillars.
# Hare removable rock at lid for use as peephole
to check pots' color (temperature).
The final test—using your pot.
270 Ultimate Guide to Wilderness Living
Notes on Aboriginal Pottery
by Steve Watts (1989)
To me, the pottery trip is divided into three parts:
1/3 is making it (Good clay, well prepared, proper temper,
and good construction techniques)
1/3 is firing it (Proper prefiring, and a thorough high firing with
adequate cool-down time)
1/3 is using it (Proper care and use for storage, cooking, and so on)
After all, using pottery is the main purpose for making it. For a pot
to be functional, it must be well made. In other, obvious words—the
better a pot is constructed and fired, the better it will operate as a
cooking vessel.
On a microscopic level, pottery starts to break down as soon as you
start to use it. But a well-made pot will last through many cookings if
taken care of and treated properly.
Pots should be stored in a secure spot, properly supported, and
protected from running children, dogs, and the like.
An underfired pot (in whole or in part) will fall apart when first
used—literally dissolve. Many pots only made for display fall into this
underfired category.
Of course shock must be avoided—putting cold water into a hot
pot or vice versa.
Some folks suggest filling the pot with water prior to use and letting
it stand in the pot long enough to thoroughly saturate the walls before
using. Others have suggested preheating and oiling the pot to season it,
à la cast iron.
Both of the procedures are probably useful, but my experience is
that with a well-made pot one simply adds "room temperature" water
plus the food to be cooked to the unheated pot and sets it on the fire.
Stoke up the flames and cook away.

Chapter 10
Brain-Tan Buckskin
I first attempted brain tanning 1974. At that time I could locate few sources
pertaining to this subject. What I did come up with left a lot to be desired.
My results were unsuccessful, but enough small bits of the skin did work out
to give me hope and show me what could be accomplished if done properly.
(I had no idea at that time what real buckskin was even like. I had read only
vague references to Indian-tanned skins.) All of what I could find on this
subject was written by someone who had no hands-on experience but was
writing what had been observed or heard. That may not be a bad way to
describe a procedure, but it's hardly the way to write a "how-to."
With more and more interest shown in going back to basics since
then, and especially the blossoming interest in buckskinning, more has
been written about some of the natural and primitive ways and skills. I
sure haven't had the opportunity to read all that has been written on brain
tanning, and probably don't know the existence of even half of it. From what
I've read, however, combined with my personal recent experiences of trying
to learn more about it, I feel that I've done a lot better than the others.
Most of what I've read, if read by someone not at all familiar with the
procedure (and, to my way of thinking, "how-to" books and articles should
be addressed to those who don't know "how to"), leaves the reader with a
lot of questions unanswered. If read with no other purpose than the joy of
reading or to further one's knowledge somewhat, fine. But most such texts
don't work for the individual interested in taking a raw deerskin and turning
Chapter 10: Brain-Tan Buckskin 273
it into a fine piece of material, especially if that individual hardly knows
what a deer is.
This chapter was written to deliberately oversimplify, because brain
tanning just isn't as difficult as most accounts tend to make it appear.
But I don't belittle the amount of effort required, when I demonstrate
that a skin can be finished in as little as nine hours—given ideal working
conditions. Of course, many, many variables can and do affect the quality of
the finished product.
It's frustrating and time-consuming to have to search out numerous
sources to learn a new skill. I've tried to make this chapter as complete
and easy to follow as what I wanted and needed when I did my first skin.
I've had my drafts read by uninformed people, both male and female, and
tried to incorporate their suggestions for clarity. I want this chapter to
work. It was designed so that the interested and motivated person with no
foreknowledge at all in skins could take this chapter, a raw deerskin, and
very minimal materials and end up with a finished buckskin. I'm satisfied
that it will do that.
I strongly suggest that you read this chapter carefully. Study the
photographs, reread, learn what's happening to the skin and why. Go over
the various steps till you know what each is accomplishing. Some parts of
this may seem complicated on the first reading, but if you study it closely
you'll find that I've made things easier and faster for you, such as lacing into
the frame. You can lace it any damn way that you want (and for one skin
maybe you should). But I feel certain that when you find out how simply
and quickly you can make buckskin, you won't stop at a single skin.
I speak throughout of the average 10-square-foot deerskin, which is a
large skin. Actually, the deer we have in north central Kansas average larger
than that. Smaller skins, of course, will require less time and effort.
I have purposely not gone into the making of anything but buckskin,
so as to keep things as simple as possible. You'll find nothing here about
working larger hides or furs. The basic principles are the same, but there are
certain differences for each. As with anything worthwhile, it will take some
effort and sweat, but not nearly what most have been led to believe. There's
no secret here—only simple rules.
274 Ultimate Guide to Wilderness Living
Brief, All-Important Summary
Pay attention. What I describe here may not actually be the scientific facts
that some are searching for, but if you understand what's put forth here
you'll know what's happening to the skin, and why. This knowledge not
only will help you to better approach the task at hand, but also will be
invaluable in troubleshooting and correcting mistakes.
First you must understand the product that you're working
with—the skin.
Meats and Fats.
Membrane •
Epidermis
The future leather (the dermis) actually consists of millions of tiny
threads. You must visualize this. Think of it as highly compressed cotton.
An inherent property of these threads is glue. Boil them down and you have
hide glue. Oils, in our case from the brains of the deer (10W motor oil might
work, and Ivory soap does too, but not as well as brains), are penetrated
completely through the dermis to coat all these threads. In the methods
illustrated here, the brains (oils) are mixed with water. Water is thinner
than the oils and therefore penetrates easier, drawing the oils with it. But
the oils won't penetrate through the membranes, sandwiching either side
of the skin. Water will. Oils won't. Thus the necessity of removing these
membranes. The inner membrane, which is a solid sheet, is easily removed,
most times done completely while fleshing. Sandpaper will show where this
has been missed. The outer membrane, the epidermis, is neither harder nor
more or less important to remove than the inner, but it's the hardest for you
to learn to remove. The epidermis is not a solid sheet. In fact, it compares
to sandpaper, with millions of tiny dots making up the grain of leather.
The epidermis is removed, in our method, by dry scraping, or removing the
hair and the epidermis at the same time. Your scraper will remove hair and
epidermis from an area about 1/4" at a lick. Work an area about 1" wide,
overlap your strokes, let your eyes penetrate into the skin—you'll eventually
see what you're removing. It does not look the same all over the skin. It may
Chapter 10: Brain-Tan Buckskin 275
take 10 to 12 strokes before you've successfully removed the epidermis from
your 1" inch wide strip. Pay attention.
Once the surfaces are prepared, the oils will be able to penetrate. We
need to coat every fiber with these oils, hence the repeated applications.
You can't overbrain. But, once oiled, if left unattended, the skin will shrink
and dry hard (the glue taking effect). If you move these lubricated fibers
on themselves while the skin dries, the oils will allow the fibers to stay
separated and they'll swell somewhat. The result: unbelievably soft, flannellike
leather.
But if this was to be wetted, the fibers would again shrink and dry hard
(the glue) unless worked. If instead we penetrate the entire, loosely woven
skin with smoke, the pitch from the smoke will waterproof the fibers. The
skin itself isn't waterproofed. Water will run through it. But the fibers will be
waterproofed, and the wetted skins will again dry soft since the water hasn't
been allowed to get to the individual fiber and allow the glue to take effect.
Once you understand this, you're in control.
(I became aware of the glue action mentioned above through Jim Rigg's
book Blue Mountain Buckskin—the importance of always learning.)
Now, a note pertaining to finishing the skin out. I describe herein
finishing it out by pulling over a rope, or also by hand. Many, many others
accomplish the same by a method described as "staking." This means, after
braining, lacing the skin back onto the frame and working the fibers by
applying force with a rounded stick.
I think of the skin, stretched on the frame after fleshing, as being
stretched 100 percent. When the skin has been cut from the frame and, after
braining, has been worked by hand, it will shrink about 20 percent. When
staked, the skin will stretch another 5 to 10 percent to its limits.
On the one hand, you end up with a larger skin. On the other, the skin,
though 25 to 30 percent smaller, is also that much thicker, and spongier, and
stretchier. To me it is alive yet.
One advantage to working the skin by hand: At any time it can be rolled
up, placed in a plastic bag, and frozen till such time as you want to get back
to it. Once you begin staking, though, you'll have to stake till you're done.

Materials
A big advantage of tanning (dressing) your skins with brains is the minimum
of expenditure required for materials. Most materials, if not all, will be on
hand in the average home.
Knife—Useful for making lacing holes. A pocket or paring knife is all
that's necessary. The only requirements are a thin, sharp blade and a good
point.
Four 2x4s about 8' long, and nails. Cedar or pine poles lashed or nailed
securely, or both, will work fine. It must be a good, solid frame.
125-150' of 1/8" nylon cord in 25-30'. lengths, or whatever else you
come up with. Nylon is easy to work with, and long-lasting.
Sandpaper—#50 coarse grit works well for medium and larger skins.
Use a finer grit for smaller, thinner skins.
278 Ultimate Guide to Wilderness Living
Brains—I've heard tell of others using liver, pancreas, and other oily
organs. I have never used anything but brains. The brain from the critter was
used "back then." Mine comes packaged neatly in 1 lb. plastic containers
from the local supermarket. Get yours where you can.
Bucket—Something in the 2- to 3-gallon size is convenient. Material
doesn't matter.
A wringer from an old wringer washer. Certainly not very primitive or
natural but sure does work well. (The stick is the natural way.)
About 15-20' of good, tight, heavy rope. The best I've found is a lariat.
Definitely something that won't unravel as you rub the skin back and forth
across it, and at least 1/2" in diameter.
Scraper—To work their skins and hides, the Indians used a section of
elk antler with either a flint or, in later times, a steel blade attached. I used
an antler once and found it ideal. With no access to elk antlers in northeast
Kansas, I use the next best, Osage orange. Any hardwood will suffice, the
heavier the better.
Chapter 10: Brain-Tan Buckskin 279
Scraper: Handle from Osage orange, blade from a file.
I used a dead piece of wood about 2" in diameter and 18" long with a
limb protruding at a 90° angle at one end. After debarking, scraping, and
sanding smooth, I sawed into the knot at a 90° angle, creating a platform on
which to tie the blade. The blade was made from a section of old file (any
hard steel will work; a file is usually handy) about 3" long, rounded on one
end and with an edge applied at a 45° angle. I tied the file to the handle and
was ready to go.
The first two skins I did were done with a well-rounded, heavy skinning
knife. I finished several using a hog scraper, well rounded. I've even used an
old hand-held flint scraper I found in a campsite.

Skins
Acquiring deerskins really isn't that difficult. There are many sources from
which you may obtain them if you look and ask around. During deer season
I can acquire 15 to 20 from friends and acquaintances who have no use for
them. There are also a number of locker plants in the area that will sell me
as many as I want at the going rate—sometimes as little as $2, but normally
closer to $5. Contact with local law and game enforcement officers also
informs me of many road kills.
Wherever you get your skins, some words of caution. Most hunters
who skin their own, and all butchers whom I've run across, take great
pride in how fast they can remove the skin from the deer. The quicker and
the cleaner that the skin is removed does no favors for the tanner but only
leaves numerous holes and "scores" (cuts into the skins not deep enough
to be holes—yet).
When I skin a deer it takes me from 15 to 30 minutes to do the job,
depending on whether it's done in the field or from the front-end loader of
a tractor. When the skin is to be tanned I'm not a fast skinner; I am careful.
The knife is used sparingly, and I leave all stubborn bits of meat and fat
on the skin. They come off easily enough later, with no appreciable loss of
meat to the hunter. By being a bit more careful I don't end up with a skin
full of holes or, worse yet, the many, many scores that can take a good No. 1
skin and turn it into a piece of crap. Light scores on the thicker part of the
skin, such as the neck, are usually acceptable, but the normal score on the
average part of the skin will, 9 times out of 10, tear out while you're working
the skin in the final stretching process. Beware of scores!
To collect as many good skins as possible, I may offer to skin them out
for local hunters, who are usually pleased as punch to have me do this for
them, especially when it's as cold as it can get around here in December. As
an added bonus I'm almost always allowed to remove the loin sinew strips also.
As for getting skins from the butcher, well, you often have to take what
you can get. Just before deer season I always go around to the processors
with whom I've made arrangements and ask them to please use the knife
sparingly. This usually helps.
There are three common ways to keep the skins till you're ready to tan
them. The oldest way is to just leave them exposed to the air till they're dry.
This is also the most time-consuming later, as they must be soaked in fresh
Chapter 10: Brain-Tan Buckskin 281
water for what seems like forever to make them as soft and pliable as
when green.
Salting the skin for preservation is the second method, and probably
the most commonly used. The flesh side is coated liberally with salt and the
excess moisture allowed to drain off. It will keep this way for six to eight
months before needing to be resalted. Although it most assuredly works, I
don't use this method myself, as it requires a lot of time and water to wash
out the salt, all of which must be removed. Salt draws moisture. Unsmoked
brain tan dries stiff if moistened.
By far the easiest way to keep them is the third way: frozen. I freeze a
skin as soon after collecting it as I can, by rolling it (hair side out); tying it in
a tight, neat bundle; and placing it in an airtight plastic bag. I'm now tanning
skins that have been frozen this way for up to three years. I believe that they
could be kept forever this way and still be as green and fresh when thawed
as the day they were put up, though you need to keep air away from the
flesh side. By keeping the skin frozen I eliminate any need to wash or soak
the skin before tanning, which saves considerable time, energy, and water.
Only the bloodiest of skins will I even wash. The skin will dry quite a bit
faster and be ready to work sooner if the hair isn't moistened.
Framing and Fleshing
Now let's do something with that skin, wherever it came from.
If it was dried, then you'd best find a source of running water, such as
a stream, and weight the skin with rocks and leave it for a couple of days
or so. It will take a long time to get it back to the same state it was in when
taken from the deer. You do need to check it every so often to ensure that
the fresh water is getting to the entire skin. If you don't have access to a
creek or a stream, place it into a large container, such as a 25-gallon trash
can, and soak. The water must be changed regularly, after only several hours
the first few times, and probably at least every 10 to 12 hours from then on
till it's workable. On warmer days be sure that the water doesn't heat enough
to rot the skin. It needs to soak till as pliable and fresh as when removed
from the deer.
A salted skin is more easily prepared. It needs only repeated washings to
remove all the salt.
Frozen skins need only to be thawed.
282 Ultimate Guide to Wilderness Living
When ready, roll the skin out on a level surface and trim the perimeter
to remove all rough edges, including the lower legs. The skin can, of course,
be tanned with the legs on but it adds a good deal of work. Right now let's
get you proficient at making buckskin. You can do any extras later, after you
master the basics.
When the skin is trimmed, stretch it to its natural shape and lay the 2x4s
around it, nailing them together, two nails per corner. We want to build the
frame about 8" to 10" larger on all sides of the skin, as the skin stretches
quite a bit while being fleshed. While nailing the frame together, fold the
skin on itself to prevent it from drying. You'll probably want to apply water
to the flesh side at intervals to keep it fresh till you're finished fleshing.
Now to lace the skin to the frame: Place it on the ground or work
table, flesh side up, and punch holes around the entire perimeter of the skin
with a thin-bladed knife. The holes are to be 1/2" to 1" from the edge and
approximately 1 1/2" to 3" apart. The easiest way to make these holes is to
Chapter 10: Brain-Tan Buckskin 283
place a board under the skin, push the point of the knife against the skin
into the board with one hand, and pull the skin up with the other. I say to
use a thin blade, because you don't want the holes too large.
To keep the natural shape of the skin square within the frame as
you lace, I've found it convenient to tie each corner of the skin to the
corresponding corner of the frame with a 12" to 15" cord. Also, place the
skin just a little off center to the right (as you face it from the bottom). After
having done a few skins, you'll find no need to tie the corners in order to
square it within the frame, though doing so sure helps the beginner.
Picture the frame in an upright position with the neck at the top and the
flesh side facing you. You'll begin lacing at the neck at the upper left corner.
From that corner, go through the hole at the corner of the neck, out under
the 2x4, and in over it again to the skin. Now begin to take the cord through
three holes at a time as if you were sewing—the cord, as it passes through
the series of three holes, runs in and out in a straight line, not wrapped
around the edge. Then take the cord out under the frame and in over it, and
then do three more holes. The cord always comes from the skin out under
the frame and back over it to the skin. I normally go through three holes at
a lick, sometimes two and very seldom four, but only as long as the holes
are in a straight line. This is to save the inconvenience of having to replace
if one of the holes rips out. As the edge of the skin turns at legs and corners,
bring your cord around the frame and begin your series of holes again. At
the neck where the skin's the thickest, I'll go through only one hole if that's
the way the count ends up at the corner.
Don't pull the cord too tightly but just "snug it up" for now. When
you reach the end of one length of cord, tie it off and begin with another.
I normally leave two or three holes (one series) for the rope that I tied off
to go through as I take up the slack. As you round the second corner and
begin the bottom, you can begin to take up some of the slack—but not too
tight now or you'll lose the shape. (Never pull too tightly on the bottom, as
it will easily tear.) After you go around the third corner and into the home
stretch, you can really begin to tighten things up, even going back to the
bottom section and taking up the remainder of the slack there. By the time
you reach the neck, whence you began, the skin will be fairly taut and close
to being centered on the frame.
284 Ultimate Guide to Wilderness Living
If the skin seems to dry some while the lacing process is going on,
simply splash water on it to keep it wet. For now you want the skin kept
fresh and pliable.
Now stand the frame, neck up, against a tree or the side of a shed. It's
best to keep the skin in the shade at this stage to keep it from drying too
fast as you flesh. It's also a good idea to always keep the frame tied to a
tree or structure so that a sudden gust of wind doesn't send it flying. Now,
beginning at the neck, tighten the ropes all around the skin till it's as tight as
a drum on the frame. You'll have to retighten these as you flesh, for the skin
will stretch considerably.
Taking the scraper (I like it very sharp, but you must be extremely
careful not to cut into the skin itself), begin at the neck and remove every bit
of the meat, fat, and membrane that you possibly can. The knife will come
in handy here at certain spots, such as around the legs and along the edges.
With some skins, this will be an easy job. With others, such as the oldtimer
trophy buck, your work will be cut out for you. You may be tempted
on some of these heavier skins to leave quite a bit on till the next step, but
believe me, now's the time to remove it. It's damn near impossible to remove
all the membrane at this point, but get what you can. Definitely get all the
meat and fat off.
Flesh, fats, and
membrane are easily
removed with scraper.
Chapter 10: Brain-Tan Buckskin
Don't attempt to clean all the way to the edge, or you'll end up cutting
the cords or ripping out the holes, or both. The perimeter is cut off later and
discarded.
Keep the skin tight within the frame. This way it fleshes much
more easily than a loose, sloppy one, plus you have a lot less chance of
accidentally cutting into it with the scraper.
Once the skin is as clean as you can get it, leave it and go on to
something else for a while. You can do nothing further with it till it's
completely dry. With the high humidity here in northeast Kansas, that can
take from six to eight hours on a good day. Drier climates will, of course,
make drying a lot faster.
When the stretched skin has dried completely, both sides must now be
prepared so that the brain matter will be allowed to penetrate completely
into the thickest areas.
I've read and heard that the skin shouldn't be allowed to dry in the sun,
for various reasons. Many times I've left my skins in full sun to help speed
the drying process and have found that it makes no difference whatsoever
in the working of the product or its finished condition. It does cause some
curling of the skin because of uneven drying, but that hasn't yet interfered in

my working of it. The hair side will naturally take longer to dry completely
to the roots and epidermis, so if you're eager to proceed you might fluff the
hair occasionally with a brush.
Figuring that you're anxiously awaiting the skin to dry enough so as to
continue the operation, begin with the flesh side when it's good and dry.
This will be about midway to when the hair side is ready. Start with the
sharp scraper and work lightly around the neck area down to the shoulders
and all the way around the perimeter of the skin. These are the areas where
you most likely left on some of the membrane, which must be completely
removed for the brain to penetrate into the skin itself. (Water, being a liquid,
will penetrate this. Brain and its accompanying oils are thicker and won't
penetrate through this membrane, nor through the epidermis on the other
side.)
Carefully work the scraper around the rough high areas of any scores, in
the direction that they lie—never across them—to even these areas off. Also,
carefully work the scraper around any holes.

Now take sandpaper and go over every inch of the surface to remove
any small bits of membrane and to level the surface. This will also have the
added benefit of "bringing up the nap," which will allow better absorbency
of the brain. Sand the neck area first and then do a strip around the entire
perimeter several inches wide. Divide the remainder into quarters and
sand them one at a time till you're positive that every square inch has been
covered. This method helps to ensure that every last bit is clean and smooth

using the sandpaper in your hand so that isolated, deliberate finger pressure
can be applied where necessary. When finished, most of the surface will be
soft and fluffy. This side is now ready for the application of the brain, but, of
course, you'll need to work the other side first. (A fur would now be ready,
but there are some different rules to follow with fur, which we won't delve
into here. In this book we're sticking to the making of buckskin.) Tanning
with hair on is covered in depth in our book Primitive Wilderness Skills,
Applied and Advanced.
To prepare the hair side, take the very sharp scraper and begin at the
neck to scrape the hair off. With a heavy, sharp scraper, this isn't much of a
chore. First, clean a strip across the top of the skin (neck). Now with long,
powerful downward strokes of the scraper, the hair will readily come off.
You'll need to sharpen the blade several times during this process, as you
want it really sharp. At the legs and at the flanks the hair lies in different
directions and you'll have to scrape in different directions to get it to come
off easily. For most of the body of the skin, what works best are good,
powerful, downward strokes. Apply less pressure around the legs and at
the flanks. It's wise to leave the flanks till last and then scrape them with a
freshly sharpened blade, applying as little pressure as needed. Should you
happen to "pop" a hole then, it won't interfere with the scraping of the rest
of the skin. It's tricky to remove the hair from around one of these holes that
just seem to pop up.
It's wise to mark any existing holes already in the skin before you begin,

because the hair hides them completely. Do this by running a piece of rope
or a small stick through each, which can be readily seen as you're dehairing.
It's easy to forget they're there, and while energetically scraping away you
may hit one of these holes and rip the skin, sometimes damn near in two.
That's a sure way to take the thrill out of working skins. It can ruin your
whole day, believe me.

When I get to dehairing, I move at a pretty fast pace, but / watch each
and every stroke of the scraper. The hair comes off easily. The epidermis,
which must also be removed (to allow the brains to penetrate), isn't always
as easy to remove. Scrape every inch of the skin till you're certain that all the
epidermis is off (very seldom is it ever entirely removed). If you closely study
the skin as you go, you'll be able to see the epidermis. It isn't a solid sheet like
the membrane on the flesh side, but more like a sandpaper coating. Although
it can be seen on any part of the skin, it's most apparent at the flanks and
other thinner areas. If the epidermis contains any moisture at all, it will be
nearly impossible to remove. The areas where the hair is the thickest (such
as the forward part of the flanks and the butt end) will be the last parts of the
skin to dry completely. In these areas I've been known to scrape very lightly
with an extremely sharp blade to remove the hair only, going back later to
remove the epidermis with either the scraper or sandpaper. Damp epidermis is
rubbery. It won't "work." You'll only tear the skin if you try.
Three scores seen from hair side, ready for sanding.
When finished with the dehairing, I've been over every square inch of
the skin. I know that the epidermis is removed and that any ridges created
while scraping have been smoothed with the scraper. Now go over the entire
surface with sandpaper as done on the other side. Caution: It's possible to
sand completely through a skin, so go tenderly at thinner areas. Sometimes
at the flanks, but especially at the scores, it may be best to leave some of the
epidermis, going over it lightly with sandpaper only to break it up enough for
the brains to penetrate. You'll have to feel a lot of this out and just do what
seems right.

Right: Skin is sanded and ready for brain.
Braining
What needs to be done now is to get the oils of the brain into every pore
and fiber of the skin. This is the easiest and fastest step of the operation.
The primary sources of brain (if not from the critter we've taken the
skin from) are slaughterhouses, butchers, or the local market. I find it most
convenient to purchase brain by the pound, packed in your basic primitive
plastic container, from the local supermarket. They cost a bit more than a
coupla bucks per pound, and one pound is plenty enough to do one skin.
You shouldn't use less than a pound, as it needs to be mixed with a certain
volume of water.
Take your pound of brain and beat it thoroughly with an egg beater or
whirl in a blender. Add just a little water, maybe a cup, and beat away. You
can get by just squishing it with your hands. The object is to liquefy the brain
as much as possible. Now add this to approximately 3/ 4 to 1 gallon of water,
bring to a boil, and simmer till grayish white, about 10 to 15 minutes. Let
this cool till just comfortably warm to the touch.
292 Ultimate Guide to Wilderness Living
With a large paintbrush or clean sponge, apply this solution to both
sides of the skin. You don't need to be too liberal with the brain solution
now. You just need to get the skin pliable enough to cut from the frame and
fold easily into the bucket. Fold the now-pliable skin into the bucket of
brain solution and work it with your hands for several minutes. With some
of the smallest, thinnest skins, that's all that's necessary. But I've never yet
let any skin get by with only one soaking in the brains. I've had too many
skins not receive a deep enough penetration of the brain, which won't be
discovered till I've spent several hours working the skin and suddenly wind
up with a stiff product—and then have to return to this stage. That's a lot of
extra work that can be easily prevented with very little effort now. There's
no special time limit that the skin has to be left soaking in the brain. Once
you've got complete penetration, you're ready to finish it out. The shortest
time for small skins would be about 15 to 20 minutes, with two soakings.
With some of the thicker, larger skins, it works well to apply several
coats of the brain before cutting from the frame. Each coat should be
allowed to dry, preferably in the sun, and then either scraped or sanded
before you apply the next coat.
Between soakings the skin must be wrung to remove as much moisture
as possible. As mentioned before, the skin will absorb water like a sponge.
Brain being a solid matter, and its oils being thicker than water, the liquefied
brain won't be absorbed into the skin as readily as plain water. With the
thinner areas, this is no problem, and one soaking is enough. The thicker
area, though, will require additional soakings. You must get all the water
out of the skin that you possibly can, so that when it's reimmersed into the
solution the water not only will bring more brain with it but also will draw
ever deeper what's already there.
The wringer from an old wringer washer works just fine for this. Run
the skin through this several times.
The traditional way of wringing out excess water, and the way that I did
all my skins till I found the wringer, is to drape the skin around a small tree
limb (or a lariat stretched tightly), overlapping it by about one third of itself,
and rolling and folding the skin onto and into itself, tucking in all loose
ends till it's tightly rolled together. The accompanying photos show this
better than I could hope to describe it. Place a solid stick (approximately
1" in diameter) through the opening and twist the skin till tight, pull, twist
some more, and then pull some more. The moisture will run and drip out
Chapter 10: Brain-Tan Buckskin 293
(place the bucket to catch the drippings). This will take only a few minutes.
Now stretch the skin as open as you can get it, and repeat. After the second
wringing, open and stretch the skin over the rope to really open the fibers
up as much as possible. Pull in all directions. This will allow the brain better
penetration on reimmersion. Return the skin to the solution. Repeat this
process till you're certain of complete penetration. The average 10 sq. ft.
skin should be put through this process four or five times. You can't get
too much brain into the skin, but you may not get enough. After the final
braining, wring the skin a few extra times to remove all possible moisture.
You'll find that this is the only stage in the process that actually attracts
flies. If a fresh skin is used, the fleshing process isn't smelly, but flies sure are
attracted to the brain.

Sewing of Holes
Holes. Every skin has a hole...or two...or three...or more. Some big, some
little, and now's the time to do something about them. On occasion I've
waited till finished with the tanning but then ended up with patches, which
don't look all that bad but are more trouble and more time-consuming than
what we'll do now. At this point I use artificial sinew for the thread. Later,
when I finish the skin out, I redo the patches with real sinew. Any strong
thread will work at this stage, but it must be strong enough to withstand the
stretching and rubbing that the skin will endure from now on.
Most holes, except bullet holes, will lie in some particular direction. Sew
them in the direction that they lie. Whip stitch the hole shut and tie off twice.
The skin will be abused from now on, so make them good, tight stitches.
Poorly sewn holes will tear out, and weak thread will break. In addition
to all holes, sew the thinner scores shut, as they too will invariably tear. Do
all the sewing from the former flesh side, because the hair side will be used
as the outside of any finished product.
Chapter 10: Brain-Tan Buckskin 295
Hole sewn before finishing. Puckers will be eliminated while stretching.
Most skins have some form of scar tissue from old wounds. The most
common are the long "scrapes" running down the center of the back, made
when the animal goes under barbed wire fences. Scrape these a little with
the small blade of a knife. Sometimes you can get rid of them, sometimes not.
You'll also often find larger areas of scar tissue, a result of a more
serious wound to the deer in the past. Cut them out now and sew the hole
shut. If these don't completely tear out as the skin's worked, they'll dry
hard. A single seam shows less and is easier to do than a patch. After the
stretching and working of the skin that follows, all puckers now visible will
be eliminated. You can leave the holes sewn as is when finished, though
often there will be stiffness where the stitches are. I resew with sinew.
Usually the hole will have to be elongated slightly when this is done, to
eliminate the pucker.
If there are many holes that require considerable time to sew, the edges
of the skin may begin to dry too much and stiffen and you may need to add
more moisture. This normally can be accomplished simply by wringing it
one more time, to disperse the moisture already in the skin.
Many times at this point, if I want to delay the next step, I'll only stretch
the skin once completely around to open the pores and then roll it in towels
(to absorb moisture), seal it tightly in a plastic bag, and put it in either the
fridge or the freezer. It can be left for several days like this in the refrigerator,
or indefinitely in the freezer. If left too long in the refrigerator it'll sour
and rot. The freezer has the additional advantage that ice crystals help
somewhat, over time, in opening and stretching the fibers.
296 Ultimate Guide to Wilderness Living
Finishing
At this point, if we were to throw the skin out on the ground or over a limb,
in a few hours it would shrink to a fraction of its size and become quite
hard. Our purpose now, therefore, is to prevent this from happening. There
are a number of methods of working the skin soft, but I'll cover only the one
I currently use, as I find it the easiest. With this method, at any point during
the drying process the skin can be rolled (as mentioned above) and placed in
the refrigerator or freezer.
The weather does, of course, affect how quickly the skin dries. My
personal preference is a slow drying day over a hot, windy one. A fast-drying
skin can be hell to keep up with.
What we have to do now is keep the fibers of the skin from doing what
they want naturally to do: shrink and pull together as they dry. For this we'll
pull and stretch the skin around the lariat all the time that it's drying. I've
read one account of a Navaho method of using hands and feet to do the
stretching, which I've done successfully on smaller skins in by the fire during
the winter. As I've said, various methods work. All methods have one thing
in common: to keep every fiber in the skin stretched and open to its fullest
while drying. Without the addition of the brain (oils), the rawhide would
still dry stiff, though not as stiff as if not stretched. The addition of the oils
allows the individual fibers to pull apart and actually swell and soften as
they dry, but we must keep each and every fiber stretched to its fullest and
moving over and past each other the entire time that the skin's drying. So
alternate pulling the skin widthwise and lengthwise. (The above action of
the brain isn't scientific fact, just my observations and the easiest way that I
know to describe what's taking place.)
Tie one end of the lariat to the base of a tree and the other to a limb
about 6' up and pull it tight. Now drape the skin around the rope and pull
it in all directions the entire time that it's drying. Begin at the neck and grab
a handful of skin and really lay into it. You don't need to worry about the
thicker parts of the skin tearing. Lean back and use your entire body weight.
Hand over hand, work your way all down the skin to the rump, then turn
it halfway and begin pulling the other direction (lengthwise), repeat...and
repeat...and repeat.
When pulling the thinner edge areas, such as the flanks, take two
handholds, one in about 6" to 8" where the skin's thicker, and pull like hell,
Chapter 10: Brain-Tan Buckskin 297
and another handhold gripped at the edge with a little lighter pull. This
ensures that the heavier central portions get enough stretching and, in the
process, you don't overdo and rip through at the thinner edge.
Left : Holding skin in 6" to 8" from edges and stretching hard.
Right: A second grip at the thinner edge and a little lighter pull.
At any point the skin may be rolled in towels and place in the
refrigerator or freezer. As it becomes drier, the towels may be omitted and
the remaining moisture allowed to disperse on the skin.
Now here's a major time and effort saver, a tip gleaned from a fellow
tanner at the '85 NAPR Western. "Why," says he, "take the extra time and
effort to roll the skin in towels and refrigerate? If you've got the time to
work it out, just throw it out onto the ground and let it air dry for 10 to 20
minutes. Then stretch it open again...and repeat till dry."
Well, I thought, if that does work—and no reason for it not to—I'd
better give it a try.
The next skin that I did was an average 10 square footer and I tried
it—a n d it worked! And what a time and effort saver it was. It took about 3
1/2 hours for me to finish that skin out, but only half that time was spent
stretching. However, you must use caution not to let the skin overdry while
it's not being worked, otherwise you'll have to go back to the brain solution.
The idea is to allow only a certain amount of the moisture to evaporate (at
the same time, the skin will shrink proportionately) and to open up the fibers
by stretching before any portion of the skin has dried beyond the point where
you're able to easily stretch and soften it. Keep a close watch on it. And if
something comes up and you want to quit, wrap and refrigerate or freeze it.
298 Ultimate Guide to Wilderness Living
You should also put the remaining brain solution in the fridge before
it sits out in a warm room too long, as it will sour in a hurry. You can use it
on another skin or you may even have to use it yet again on this one if you
haven't gotten complete penetration. I've used the same solution, with the
addition of more brain and water, on as many as 10 skins—but that's just
being cheap. Fresh solution seems to work better.
At this point I think of the skin as being in one of three stages—wettest,
medium wet, and dry. In the wettest stage, the skin will spend more time
on the ground than on the rope. The midpoint of drying is the more critical
stage, and you'll spend more time stretching or rubbing. When you're pretty
sure that the skin is dry and you're just ascertaining that fact, you can spend
less time on the rope.
At about the time the thinner areas are drying out, concentrate your
efforts on the thicker neck, back, and ham areas.
This is also the stage that the term "blood, sweat, and tears" pertains to.
Unconditioned knuckles will blister and bleed. It helps to use bandages over
the first knuckle joint, or tight-fitting rubber gloves with fingertips cut off.
Time will toughen them.
Begin rubbing the skin around the rope while stretching as soon as it
dries enough to do so easily. This helps to crush and stretch the fibers, raises
the nap to a fluffier texture, and creates friction that helps speed the drying
process somewhat. Rub with vigor.
Don't quit till you're positive that the skin is dry. Any little bit of
moisture will detract from a No. 1 quality piece of buckskin. Remember
that as long as there's any moisture at all left in the skin, it will shrink and
stiffen as it dries. If you stayed with it, the average 10 sq. ft. skin would take
approximately 3 1/2 to 4 hours to finish out.
The finished buckskin will be creamy white in color and as soft and
fluffy as the best of flannel. But.. .if this fine piece of material were allowed
to get wet (and remember, it will seem to draw moisture, just as brain and
other things will draw flies), you'd find yourself back to where you were
four hours ago. If it's allowed to dry naturally, it will shrink and stiffen. So
though we've got a fine piece of buckskin, we're certainly not finished with
it. It makes no sense to devise clothing or bags if we can't actually use it.

When stretching, really lay into it.

Smoking
What we do now is smoke the skin. As with the oils of the brain, we need
to penetrate smoke into every fiber of the now-soft buckskin. I've heard of
various things this does to the skin, but I've never definitively learned how it
does it. I do know it works, however, and it's a necessary step to end up with
a useful piece of material that will dry soft (or will require only a minimum
of rubbing) after a good wetting.
The old way of smoking skins is to sew it into a cone from the neck to
the rump, leaving the rump open. Into a hole in the ground (roughly 6" in
diameter by 18" deep), place hot coals to a depth of 6" to 8" and cover with
punky wood. What's wanted is a smudge of dense, warm smoke. Stake the
open end of the skin over the smudge and tie the neck area to a low tree
limb or a tripod. Smoke can also be piped to the hanging skin a number
of feet away, making it easier to control the fire or smoke and eliminating
the possibility of scorching the skin. It's a good idea, also, to sew a piece of
material, such as denim or canvas, to the bottom of the skin as additional
security against scorching. Keep the skin open so that the warm, dense
smoke can penetrate overall. When you see the discoloration of the smoke
seeping through the thinner areas, invert the skin and smoke it from the
other direction.
This is certainly the quickest way to smoke one skin, or just a few
of them. Not including the sewing and setup time, the actual smoking
takes from 15 to 30 minutes per side, depending on how dark a shade is
desired. This method actually forces the smoke through the skin, whereas
in the tipi method (described next) the smoke is absorbed by exposure and
therefore takes considerably more time for complete penetration. I seldom
use this method, as it requires my constant attention and I normally have
a number of skins to smoke at one time. I've read, and been told, that the
smoke has to be warm to accomplish its mission. Cold smoke apparently
won't work. Myself, I've never tested the cold smoke theory.
I smoke 99 percent of my skins in a tipi. I've used a small shed before,
which is fine for pelts or individual skins but too small for any quantity of
skins. I know of some people who place their stove right in the lodge. This
is inconvenient, to my way of thinking, as they must burn the coals outside
and then transport them to the stove to avoid scorching the skins. It's also
much easier to tend the smudge in the smokefree out-of-doors. I place my
Chapter 10: Brain-Tan Buckskin 301
18' lodge next to a ledge, put the stove below, and pipe the smoke about 12'
to the center of the lodge. I also put a rain cap on the end of the pipe to
help disperse the rising smoke, which promotes more consistent coloring of
the skins.
Tie the skins to the uppermost part of the poles. I run a piece of heavy
thread through the edge of the skin with a needle and then tie it around the
poles loose enough to hang free so that all parts are exposed to the smoke.
They could also be tacked to the poles. Either very long legs or a stepladder
is necessary. With this method you can hang 8 to 12 skins, depending on the
size of both skins and lodge, and all will come out the same shade and color.
After closing the smoke flaps tight as if for a storm, with liner in place, put
a towel or two in the crotch formed by the poles to slow the escape of the
smoke as much as possible.
Before hanging the skins, build a large fire in the stove, using a
hardwood that will produce long-lasting coals. Oak is my favorite, though
charcoal will suffice. Remember to disconnect the pipe. By the time the
skins are hung and the lodge is closed tight, the coals should be about right.
Replace the pipe so as to heat it quickly to create a good draft, and then
almost immediately cover the coals with fine-shredded, punky wood. The
rottenest, most punky wood that you can find is the best. Don't confuse
soft, wet wood with rotten, punky. If wet when gathered, spread it out to
dry. The wood needs to be punky and unburnable to create the dense smoke
that's necessary.
302 Ultimate Guide to Wilderness Living
We don't need to add moisture by burning wet stuff. I've tried using
green wood, which burns even hotter than the dry oak. We don't want
straight heat, which could scorch the skins. A combination of punky
cottonwood and red cedar sawdust leaves my skins a light, bright, lively
tan. The same combination used in the first method of forcing the smoke
through, is much darker and not nearly so lively. The choice of woods will
dictate the final coloring.
I begin this project early in the morning on a day when no rain is
expected in the immediate future. Rain will always enter the lodge at the
apex and run down the poles, and you're taking a chance when you hang
a dozen unsmoked skins in a lodge. A sudden squall would create havoc.
By hanging them early in the morning of a clear day, I can begin the actual
smoking before 8 a.m. and by the time that I quit for the day at about 10
p.m., I feel secure that if it does rain during the night enough smoke has
penetrated the skins that a bit of moisture won't hurt. I would, though, have
the skins cut down and in the house at the first hint of a storm within the
first day and a half of smoking.
To keep a steady, heavy cloud rising from the stove, you'll have to
stir the coals every 20 minutes or so and keep adding more punk when
necessary. Every two to three hours you'll also need to rebuild the fire for
more coals. Note: Don't forget to disconnect the pipe when doing this!
I follow this process for three 12- to 14-hour days while working on
other skins only a few feet from the stove. Late in the afternoon of the third
day I remove the skins, soak them in cold well water, and hang them from
a clothesline. Most everything that I've read on the smoking of skins says to
place them in a sack overnight to allow the smoke and color to set. I don't
do this and have had no ill effects with my results. After the skins have
dried, I pull and rub each one by hand to ensure that the smoke has done its
job, and then let them air for a number of days.
That's it. You now have a fine piece of buckskin that's worth $10 or
more per square foot. Better than that, you have the satisfaction of having
taken a raw piece of material from nature (no kit here!) and, by your own
labors, have created a fine, beautiful, useful finished product—something
that you can point to and honestly proclaim with pride, "/ made this. "

"Hair-on" Supplement
Leaving the hair on when brain tanning requires the application of a few
different rules. The skin (pelt, hide, whatever) should not be soaked in the
brain solution as with buckskin, as this can result in hair slippage. Instead,
the brain should be painted on the former flesh side, allowed to dry, the
dried brain "film" scraped off, and then repeated till you're certain that
you have complete penetration. Remember that you're penetrating from
only one side. With the same thickness buckskin, that might require eight
applications (soakings and wringings), but here you'll have to do more than
twice that number. Thinner pelts (fox, cats) might get by with only one or
two applications (I would do four or five at least; remember that you can't
possibly overbrain). The thickest, toughest pelt that I've done is the beaver.
After successfully doing five extra-large, blanket-sized ones, I wouldn't
hesitate to apply the solution as many as 40 to 50 times. This means lots of
work, though the fine finished results have been well worth the effort. (I can
do a couple of buckskins in the time that it takes to do a large beaver.) The
beaver I skin "open" and stretch around on a willow hoop or some such. I
lace it, using needle and artificial sinew (waxed nylon) thread, stitches about
1" apart. Lace it with the holes pretty close to the edge and be especially
careful around the face. What we're trying to do is save all we can.
I prefer to work all other pelts "case" skinned. The dried pelt can be
kept on the stretcher for the brainings. When the legs are left on, I staple
them open to thin slats. I skin the paws as open as I can and soak them in
the brain (they should be "tanned," but I know nothing of that; I only do
things the natural way, though soaking in the oils of the brain can't hurt).
Ears should be skinned out to the very tip; I also soak these. All meats and
fats must be removed from these areas or they will eventually rot, if gotten
wet, and the hair will then slip. The final coat of brain can be applied,
applied, and applied once more. Saturate it as much as you can, then maybe
place a warm, damp towel (damp with brain solution is fine) on the flesh
side, place it in a plastic sack, and allow it to stand till it becomes as pliable
as when green. Don't overdo it, or it could begin to rot and cause hair
slippage. Then work it over the rope or by hand till it's dry and soft.
For deer with the hair on, I wouldn't even bother with brain tanning,
The hollow hairs of the deer break off if you even look hard at them. The
only practical use for a hair-on deer is as a wall hanging, and even then it
Chapter 10: Brain-Tan Buckskin 305
doesn't need to be soft. I have done one deer robe. No more! It was nice,
but you can't do anything with it but pick up hairs wherever you might visit,
eventually ending up with a piece of buckskin anyhow. It's just not worth
the extra work, and it is a huge amount of extra work. I've read where
Indians just threw the raw skin on the floor of the lodge, and when the hair
all fell out they had a softened piece of rawhide ready to brain into buckskin.
One that you wanted for a wall hanging could be saturated with pure neat'sfoot
oil (for better penetration), or brained and only worked semisoft.
Yet if you insist—and also for elk, buffalo, and other creatures—here are
some tips to kinda help you along.
Follow the preparation steps up through page 288. Now, I'm not talking
about skins or hides with the legs or faces left on. Then begin to paint the
brain solution on, scraping between coatings as with the pelts. Apply, apply,
and apply again—you can't do too much. You will have to judge as to how
many coatings each pelt will need. Finally, lay the frame out flat and apply
the brain till the skin's saturated. (You might even repeat this several times.)
When the pelt's as pliable as when green, don't cut it from the frame, as
there will be too much bulk for you to work over a rope. Instead, stand the
frame up and, beginning with a canoe paddle (or something similar), begin
to run a tool down the hide. You'll be stretching the hide and at the same
time squeegeeing the moisture out. You'll only be working the flesh side. The
epidermis will restrict the stretching process, and you'll work your butt off,
but keep at it. You must, till it's dry and soft. As the hide gets drier, graduate
to a smaller stick to stretch with (a rounded-down ax handle will work well).
Along about now you'll begin to wish that you hadn't begun this
project. You'll think it's a "buster," but it'll be worth it. Someone once
showed me an old photo of Native American women "playing" by bouncing
children up and down on a buffalo hide like a trampoline. "Playing,"
hell—they were stretching the hide soft! Whichever way you decide to do
this, it must be continued till it's completely finished. No half-hour breaks
here. For this project it would be best to have one or more helpers. If you've
properly prepared the surface and applied enough brain to achieve complete
penetration, and if you keep the proper stretching up till it's completely dry,
you'll end up with a fine robe indeed.
It's best to smoke the finished pelt or robe in a smokehouse or in the
tipi. If the legs and face are left on, it'll be impossible to sew into a bag.

This is only a quickie jotting of supplementary notes for hair-on brain
tanning and is far from complete. Still, when used in conjunction with the rest

Sewing with Sinew
Assuming that you're reading this because you're either involved in
buckskinning or just interested in a more natural way of life, I want to
show you how to use another completely natural product for the threads
when turning your buckskin into clothing or whatever other products
you're making.
Sinew, on a critter, is a tendon. "Critter," in our case, is most likely a
deer. On our critter we have two sources of convenient, usable sinew: the
tendons of the legs and the loin sinew, of which there are two flat strips, one
lying on either side of the backbone on top of the meat.
The leg tendons are shorter and more difficult to work into threads.
Since I have no first-hand experience working with leg tendons, I'll cover
only the more easily workable loin sinew.
Elk loin sinew will run a little over 2' in length, buffalo closer to 3'. Deer
sinew, which I mostly use, runs about 15" to 18" long and is finer than the
other two animals'. Sinew can be obtained from some buckskinning supply
houses. A single strip contains a hearty supply of threads.
I obtain all my deer sinew directly from the critter. Stripping isn't a
difficult chore, but when deer are usually available to me the temperature
has a tendency to be well below the freezing mark. Although working
with bare hands makes the job of removal much easier, it can be mighty
uncomfortable. The sinew can't be removed from a frozen carcass.
A dull knife run under tendon while attached to deer.
Chapter 10: Brain-Tan Buckskin 307
Final scraping clean of strip. Bottom has been pulled loose from carcass while
top remains attached.
Most times, the sinew is available from a deer whose skin is also
obtainable. After skinning, make a cut up against and parallel to the
backbone about 1/4" deep. With your fingers, pull away the outer layer of
fat and expose the silvery sinew lying atop the meat and running from the
shoulder to the hip, 1" to 2" wide and tapering. Take a dull knife (a butter
knife works well) and about midway in length run this under the sinew and
begin working the blade in either direction, separating the meat from the
sinew. Caution: Too sharp a blade will cut the tendon. Clean the strip only
to where it enters the hip, or goes into the shoulder, whichever way you're
working. Leave it attached to the carcass and clean it the other way. When
it's separated the entire length, but still attached at both ends, continue
to run the knife back and forth several times to get the strip as clean as
possible. Remove all meat and fat. When this is as clean as you can get it,
begin to work the knife into the hip till it pulls free at that end and then
remove it from the shoulder. You'll need to cut somewhat into the meat at
the ends to free the entire strip. Once it's loose from the critter, again scrape
both sides till completely clean and then lay it out on a flat surface to dry.
When you buy loin sinew from a source, this is what you'll get.
308 Ultimate Guide to Wilderness Living
The dried loin sinew strip.
Getting individual threads from this is easy. Grab the strip between
thumb and forefinger of each hand, close together, and work the sinew
back and forth and around and around for a few seconds. This will break
the strip into individual threads. Do this the entire length and you'll have
a real conglomeration of threads that can be stripped off as needed in the
thickness desired: thicker threads for sewing soles to moccasins, medium
threads for general-purpose garment and bag sewing, and fine delicate
threads necessary for quill or bead work. These finer strands are the most
difficult to work loose in any length, but with a bit of care and patience it
can be done.
Sinew is surprisingly strong, as it must be to have served as bowstrings
for the very powerful Plains Indians' sinew-backed bow. It's certainly as
strong as most of our modern-day threads.
Sinew threads can be pulled off individually as needed, or many made
up in advance. When making them ahead of time I find it easier to separate
them if the strip is wetted first (after having broken the threads apart).
Toward the middle of the strip, at the edge, begin to work the fibers free
in the thickness desired. As this is worked loose you'll find that toward the
wide end of the strip the thread will be somewhat thicker than at the other.
This is the forward end of the thread. When the thread is separated wet,
I use my mouth on it till soft, then lay it on a flat surface to dry. When you're
ready to begin sewing, wet the thread thoroughly as before and thread the
thick end through a needle (a glovers needle works best) and go to it. Before
the availability of the needle, the Indians would let the thicker end dry, and
that would stiffen enough to suffice as a needle through a hole punched
with an awl. You'll discover that with brain-tanned skins you won't require
a thimble.
Chapter 10: Brain-Tan Buckskin 309
Instead of a knot at the end of the thread, sew through the material
once and then again to create a loop through which you'll wrap (tie) the
thread three times and then pull tight. Let about 3/4" of the tail of the thread
lie in line with your stitching and sew it under as you go. As the sinew dries
it will shrink slightly and stiffen, conforming to the stitching and creating a
tight knot and seam. Pull the stitches as tight as possible. When the thread
breaks you'll know that it's too tight. When you reach the end of one thread,
tie it off as you began (a loop and wrapped three times). Pull it tight, and let
the end of the thread run in line with and under the next stitches.
When the end of the seam is reached, tie the thread off twice, just in
case. Then take the needle and run the thread "through" the center of the
buckskin for about 1 " and cut it off (try this with commercially tanned
leather!—can't be done). Take the rounded butt end of your scissors, or
something similar, and flatten the seams. Of course, all seams are sewn
inside out. As mentioned before, all sewing with brain tan is on the former
flesh side, the former hair side being the outside.

<h2>Survival Part2</h2>
<article>
The advances in the development of outdoor clothing, equipment, emergency food
and techniques have been growing rapidly in recent years. For those beginners
interested in using the outdoors there is unlimited information on wilderness survival
skills and equipment available. However, experience is the best teacher in any
outdoor situation and your reaction in a wilderness survival situation depends on
your education. Always keep in mind that it can happen to you. Those who are
mentally and physically prepared to survive are more likely to do so. To deal with an
emergency situation one must be able to make decisions, improvise and remain
calm.
Fear - For anyone faced with a wilderness emergency survival situation, fear is a
normal reaction. Unless an emergency situation has been anticipated, fear is
generally followed by panic then pain, cold, thirst, hunger, fatigue, boredom and
loneliness. It is extremely important to calmly assess the situation and not allow
these seven enemies to interfere with your survival.
Pain - Pain may often be ignored in a panic situation. Remember to deal with
injuries immediately before they become even more serious.
Cold - Cold lowers the ability to think, numbing the body and reducing the will to
survive. Never allow yourself to stop moving or to fall asleep unless adequately
sheltered.
Thirst - Dehydration is a common enemy in an emergency situation and must not be
ignored. It can dull your mind, causing you to overlook important survival
information.
Hunger - Hunger is dangerous but seldom deadly. It may reduce your ability to
think logically and increase your susceptibility to the effects of cold, pain and fear.
Fatigue - Fatigue is unavoidable in any situation so it is best to keep in mind that it
can and will lower your mental ability. Remember that in an emergency situation this
is often the bodies way of escaping a difficult situation.
Boredom & Loneliness - These enemies are quite often unanticipated and may
lower the mind's ability to deal with the situation.
HOW TO:
Build a Fire
Building a fire is the most important task when dealing with survival in the
wilderness. Be sure to build yours in a sandy or rocky area or near a supply of sand
and water as to avoid forest fires. The most common mistakes made by those
attempting to build a fire are: choosing poor tinder, failing to shield precious
matches from the wind and smothering the flames with too large pieces of fuel. The
four most important factors when starting a fire are spark - tinder - fuel - oxygen.
The most common ways to create spark are:
1. Waterproof, strike-anywhere matches are your best bet. Matches may be waterproofed
by dipping them in nail polish. Store your matches in a waterproof container.
2. A cigarette lighter is also a good way to produce a spark, with or without fuel.
3. The flint and steel method is one of the oldest and most reliable methods in fire
starting. Aim the sparks at a pile of dry tinder to produce a fire.
4. The electric spark produced from a battery will ignite a gasoline dampened rag.
5. Remove half of the powder from a bullet and pour it into the tinder. Next place a
rag in the cartridge case of the gun and fire. The rag should ignite and then may be
placed into the tinder.
6. Allow the suns rays to pass through a magnifying glass onto the tinder.
Dry grass, paper or cloth lint, gasoline-soaked rags and dry bark are all forms of
tinder. Place your tinder in a small pile resembling a tepee with the driest pieces at
the bottom. Use a fire starter or strip of pitch if it is available.
It is important to keep in mind that smaller pieces of kindling such as, twigs, bark,
shavings and gasoline, are necessary when trying to ignite larger pieces of fuel.
Gather fuel before attempting to start your fire. Obviously dry wood burns better and
wet or pitchy wood will create more smoke. Dense, dry wood will burn slow and hot.
A well ventilated fire will burn best.
Build a Shelter
A small shelter which is insulated from the bottom, protected from wind and snow
and contains a fire is extremely important in wilderness survival. Before building
your shelter be sure that the surrounding area provides the materials needed to
build a good fire, a good water source and shelter from the wind.
Wilderness shelters may include:
1. Natural shelters such as caves and overhanging cliffs. When exploring a possible
shelter tie a piece of string to the outer mouth of the cave to ensure you will be able
to find your way out. Keep in mind that these caves may already be occupied. If you
do use a cave for shelter, build your fire near its mouth to prevent animals from
entering.
2. Enlarge the natural pit under a fallen tree and line it with bark or tree boughs.
3. Near a rocky coastal area, build a rock shelter in the shape of a U, covering the
roof with driftwood and a tarp or even seaweed for protection.
4. A lean-to made with poles or fallen trees and a covering of plastic, boughs, thick
grasses or bark is effective to shelter you from wind, rain and snow.
5. A wigwam may be constructed using three long poles. Tie the tops of the poles
together and upright them in an appropriate spot. Cover the sides with a tarp,
boughs, raingear or other suitable materials. Build a fire in the center of the
wigwam, making a draft channel in the wall and a small hole in the top to allow
smoke to escape.
6. If you find yourself in open terrain, a snow cave will provide good shelter. Find a
drift and burrow a tunnel into the side for about 60 cm (24 in) then build your
chamber. The entrance of the tunnel should lead to the lowest level of you chamber
where the cooking and storage of equipment will be. A minimum of two ventilating
holes are necessary, preferably one in the roof and one in the door.
CLOTHING AND EQUIPMENT
Clothing
Clothing must provide warmth and offer protection from the elements. Layers of
light, natural fibers are best. Hats are a must, as they offer protection from both the
heat and cold. Water proof outer layers are necessary.
Equipment
Equipment must be easily manageable and promote survival in any situation. Items
to carry in your pockets may include a fire starter, waterproof matches and/or
lighter, a pocket knife, goggles, compass, small first-aid kit and some sort of trail
food.

Survival Kit
Items for your survival kit should be packed in a waterproof container that can
double as a cooking pot and water receptacle and be attached to your belt.
Backpack
In addition to a survival kit, a good, comfortable backpack is mandatory. Loads of
about 18 kg (40 lb.) are average. Items to include are; flashlight, extra jacket, socks
and mittens, a pocket saw, gas camp stove, first aid kit, emergency food, and a tent
and fly.
CHECK LIST
Useful items to include on your hike are:
1. A map and compass.
2. A large, bright plastic bag will be useful as a shelter, signaling device or in lieu of
raingear.
3. A flashlight with extra batteries.
4. Extra water and food.
5. Extra clothing such as raingear, a toque and gloves, a sweater and pants.
6. Sun protection such as sunglasses, sunscreen, a hat and long sleeved clothing.
7. A sharp pocket knife.
8. Waterproof matches, a lighter and/or a flint.
9. Candles and fire starter.
10. A first aid kit.
11. A whistle, flares, a tarp.
Wilderness Survival: Travel In the Woods
If you do become lost, stay where you are. Build a fire and carefully assess the
situation. Do not use precious energy by wandering aimlessly.
During the winter months use game trails which will help you avoid walking in the
deep snow. Frozen streams and rivers are also easy to follow but watch for weak ice.
MEASURING DISTANCE
When measuring distance the most effective method is the tally and pace system:
1 pace = 75 cm (29.25 in)
1 double pace = 150 cm or 1.5 m (58.5 in)
66 double paces = 99 m (107.9 yards) = 1 tally (tie a knot in a string for each tally)
10 tallies = 1000 m or 1 km (0.62 mi)
FINDING DIRECTION
Using a Compass
(Note: When using a compass in coastal British Columbia, it will read 22 degrees
east of true north. More time must be allowed to read a bearing during the winter
months as it takes longer for the needle to finish swinging.)
A magnetic-Sylva type compass is a lost hiker's best friend. First, decide which
direction you want to follow then aim over the centre of your compass to the bearing
you want to follow and find a landmark on this sighting. After arriving at this
landmark repeat the process. Using this pattern you will follow a relatively straight
line.
Using the Stars
For those unfortunate enough to not have a compass, using the pole star for
direction will suffice. Simply located the pole star and you will be facing north. To
find this star use the Big Dipper constellation. The pole star will be located off of the
top of the "dipper", on the opposite side of the handle.
METHODS OF NAVIGATION
There are three common methods of navigation:
1. Map reading is a common method used, particularly in developed areas. Maps and
aerial photos may be used when landmarks are clear.
2. Using a compass in conjunction with maps and aerial photos is wise in areas
without good landmarks.
3. Navigation by dead reckoning is common in areas where landmarks are nonexistent
or inadequate. This method combines plotting and recording of a series of
courses, measured by distance and direction from a starting point.
* It is important to stay alert and observe all unusual landmarks.
Difficulties in navigation may occur for several reasons. Some of these include
WHEN YOU'RE LOST IN THE WOODS
The most important thing to remember if you find yourself in this situation is not to
panic. First, treat any injuries within your party. Next, establish that your basic
needs are met. These include heat, shelter, water and food. Then consult your map
and compass and try to recognize or remember landmarks you may have passed.
To determine how many hours of daylight are left, face the sun and extend your arm
towards it. Bend your wrist inwards and place your fingers just below the sun.
Disregarding your thumb, count how many fingers separate the sun from the
horizon. Each finger will represent fifteen minutes.
If it is nearing dark, build a shelter and fire that is on high ground and out of the
wind. Have a snack and a hot drink and get some rest. Don't waste precious energy
by trying to find your way in the dark.
During daylight hours it is important to find a way to signal to others. A fire is best.
Be sure to find a means with which to carry water. If you must move be sure to
leave markers that searchers can follow.
SIGNALS
A fire is the safest method to use when signaling for help. The smoke is easily
spotted during the day and the flames by night. Three signal fires laid 30 m (98 feet)
apart and lit when a aircraft passes is a good way to indicate your distress. The
Morse Code emergency signal is S...O...S... and may be sent with a flashlight and
consists of three dots followed by three dashes followed by three dots. The dashes
should be twice as long as the dots. Messages or signal letters may be drawn in the
snow. A signal mirror is also a very effective method used. Flash the mirror along the
horizon regardless of whether a plane is in view.
Wilderness Survival: Food & Water
FINDING FOOD & WATER
In a wilderness survival situation, it is possible to live for extended periods of time
on little or no food. Research shows that a healthy individual can survive on 500
calories a day with no side effects and with plenty of water and a comfortable resting
place can live approximately three weeks without food. During cold weather or
periods of heightened activity more food is required to maintain a normal body
temperature.
Water is much more important. Two to three cups of water are required each day to
stay healthy. It is wise to conserve the water in your body by reducing activities that
may promote water loss.
Finding water during the summer months is quite easy. Running water such as
springs or streams in isolated areas is generally safe for consumption but be aware
that water in stagnant areas such as sloughs and ponds may carry disease and
should either be boiled for a minimum of three minutes, or iodine (nine drops per
quart) or halazone tablets added.
It is wise to carry a water purification pump with you. This allows the hiker to make
use of stagnant water in any situation and it is not necessary to carry water with
you. In areas where no surface water is available, dig into damp soil and allow this
muddy water to settle and become clear. Water may also be found on the dew of
plants, by collecting rainwater or in fish juices.
During the winter months it is wise to look for water under ice. Melting ice as
opposed to snow is more fuel efficient. Remember that hard-packed snow will yield
more water than light, fluffy snow. Do not eat snow as it tends to dehydrate the
body.
Finding food in the wilderness may prove slightly more difficult but by no means
impossible. Try and sustain with natural foods before using your emergency survival
kit rations.
If water is not readily available try to limit your food consumption to carbohydrates,
as proteins use more water to digest. Keep in mind that all fur-bearing animals and
grass seeds are edible and that there is more food value in the roots of plants than
the greens.
Extra care should be taken when consuming seafood. Try to avoid mussels during
the summer months as they contain certain toxins which are not present during the
winter. Sea urchins, a prickly purple or green sea creature, may be consumed by
breaking them open and eating the red or yellow eggs inside. Steam snails, clams
and limpets. Frogs, snakes, lizards and birds are also edible. Remove the head,
entrails and skin before adding them to the pot.
POISONOUS PLANTS
Care should be taken when consuming any unknown plant in the wilderness. Avoid
red and white berries, and plants resembling beans, melons and cucumber as they
are often poisonous. There are a large variety of mushroom species, most are edible
but some are extremely dangerous and should be avoided unless you can positively
identify them. Water hemlock is a particularly poisonous plant which is found in
swampy areas of British Columbia. It grows up to two meters, with hollow roots and
small white flowers. The dangerous baneberry plant grows up to one meter tall and
produces small white flowers and white or red berries.
FISHING & HUNTING
Setting snares, traps, nets and set lines will assist you in finding food to help with
your survival. Trails are excellent places to set snares. Animal tracks offer
information pertaining to the type of animal, its size and the direction it was headed.
Following these tracks will often lead to water-holes and feeding grounds where you
may use your traps or snares.

Hyperthermia<p>
When journeying into the wilderness it is important to carry a complete first aid kit
and book. It is also wise to take a first aid course. A good diet, cleanliness and
appropriate clothing will lower the risk of harmful situations.
Disease, infection and often, insect bites can be avoided when maintaining a proper
diet. It is important to bathe daily but if this is not possible be sure to wash your
hands frequently. Soap can be made using ashes and animal fat or by boiling the
inner bark of a pine tree. Construct a toothbrush by mashing the end of a green
twig. When setting out for your journey remember to pack a wide range of clothing
and extra footwear.
FIRST AID
If an accident occurs in the wilderness it will be your responsibility to deal with the
situation. The specific sequence of actions when dealing with this situation is:
1. Remain calm, providing your patient with quiet, efficient first aid treatment.
2. Keep the patient warm and lying down. Do not move this injured person until you
have discovered the extent of the injuries.
3. Start mouth-to-mouth artificial respiration immediately if the injured person is not
breathing.
4. Stop any bleeding.
5. Give your patient reassurance. Watch carefully for signs of shock.
6. Check for cuts, fractures, breaks and injuries to the head, neck or spine.
7. Do not allow people to crowd the injured person.
8. Do not remove clothing unless it is imperative.
9. Decide if your patient can be moved to a proper medical facility. If this is not
possible, prepare a suitable living area in which shelter, heat and food are provided.
SHOCK
Shock is a depression of all of the body processes and may follow any injury
regardless of how minor. Factors such as hemorrhage, cold and pain will intensify
shock. When experiencing shock the patient will feel weak and may faint. The skin
becomes cold and clammy and the pulse, weak and rapid. Shock can be more
serious than the injury itself.
Use the following method to prevent and control shock:
1. When treating injuries:
i. restore breathing
ii. stop bleeding
iii. treat breaks and fractures
2. If there are no head or chest injuries place the patient on his/her back with the
head and chest lower than the legs. This will help the blood circulate to the brain,
heart, lungs and other major organs.
3. If severe head and chest injuries are present elevate the upper body. If chest
injuries are present, elevate the injured side to assist in the functioning of the
uninjured lung.
4. If the injured person becomes unconscious, place him/her in a face down position
to prevent choking on blood, vomit or the tongue.
5. Keep your patient warm and under shelter.
STOPPED BREATHING
If breathing has stopped, begin mouth-to-mouth resuscitation. Place the patient on
his/her back and follow these steps:
1. To open the airway lift the patient's neck and tilt the head back.
2. Keeping the neck elevated, pinch the nostrils to prevent air leakage.
3. Place your mouth completely around the victim's mouth and blow, watching for
chest expansion.
4. After removing your mouth, listen for air leaving the patient's lungs and watch for
the chest to fall. Check for an airway blockage if the chest does not rise.
Repeat these steps approximately 12 to 15 times per minute. If treating a child,
cover the nose and mouth with you mouth. Use smaller puffs of air and repeat this
method 20 to 25 times per minute.
BLEEDING
To control bleeding, elevate the wounded area above the heart and apply pressure
using either gauze, clean cloth, dried seaweed or sphagnum moss. Use pressure at
the pulse point between the injured area and the heart if bleeding fails to stop. If
bleeding still persists, use a tourniquet between the injury and the heart. This
method should only be used in extreme situations. After bleeding has been
controlled, wash the wounded area with disinfectant and apply a dressing and
bandages.
FRACTURES
A fracture is classified as either a simple (closed) or compound (open). Signs that a
fracture is present include:
1. Pain at the affected area.
2. The area may or may not be deformed.
3. The victim is unable to place weight on the area without experiencing pain.
4. A grating sensation or sound may be present during any motion of the injured
area.
Treatment is as follows:
1. If in doubt, treat the injury as a fracture.
2. Splint the joints above and below the fracture.
3. If the fracture may penetrate the skin, it could be necessary to apply traction to
straighten the deformity.
4. Be sure to pad your splints.
5. Check the splint ties frequently to be sure they do not hinder circulation.
6. Cover all open wound with a clean dressing before splinting.
DISLOCATION
Dislocation happens when the ligaments near a joint tear, allowing the movement of
the bone from its socket. It is unwise to treat a dislocation unless you are a trained
professional as permanent damage may occur. The affected extremity should be
supported using a sling or other device and pain controlled with aspirin or other
suitable drugs.
SPRAINS
Treat sprains by applying cold to the area for the first 24 hours then once the
swelling has subsided, let the sprain sit for a day. Apply heat the following day to aid
in the healing process. The sprain should be splinted and rendered immobile until the
pain has completely disappeared.
CONCUSSIONS
Concussions or other head injuries are often accompanied by a leakage of watery
blood from the nose or ears. Other symptoms may include convulsions, an
unresponsiveness of the pupils or headache and vomiting. Keep the injured party
warm, dispense a pain killer regularly and allow time for the body to rest and repair.
HEAT EXHAUSTION
Heat exhaustion is not uncommon when water is not sufficient. The body becomes
dehydrated and salt-depleted, resulting in nausea, faintness, a weak, rapid pulse
and/or cold and clammy skin. Treatment includes plenty of rest, liquid and salt
tablets.
SUNSTROKE
Sunstroke may occur when the body is exposed to excessive sun. The body becomes
overheated and provides too much blood to the circulatory system resulting in a
flushed, hot face, rapid pulse, headache and/or dizziness. Treat sunstroke by resting
in a cool area and applying and consuming cold liquid. Prevent sunstroke by wearing
proper headgear.
MUSCLE CRAMPS
Muscle cramps occur when the muscle accumulates excessive lactid acid or a loss of
salt through perspiration. Treatment includes resting, deep breathing and stretching.
Restore the salt balance immediately.
BURNS
Burns are most commonly followed by shock. Administer a pain reliever immediately,
apply gauze covered in Vaseline to the affected area and bandage. The patient
should consume more water than usual.
SNOWBLINDNESS
Symptoms of snowblindness include scratchy or burning eyes, excessive tearing,
sensitivity to light, headache, halos around light and temporary loss of vision.
Bandage the victim's eyes and use cold compresses and a painkiller to control the
pain. Vision will generally be restored after 18 hours without the help of a doctor.
Always wear snow goggles or sunglasses in snowy areas to prevent snowblindness.
FROSTBITE
Frostbite occurs when the tissue of an area, most commonly the toes, fingers or
face, is frozen either from direct exposure to the elements or high wind. First degree
frostbite turns the area cold, white and numb. When heated the area becomes red
and can be compared to a first degree burn. A blister will form after warming with
second degree frostbite. Dark skin, gangrene, and a loss of some skin and tissues is
common in third degree. Fourth degree frostbite causes irreparable damage. The
affected area will remain cold and lifeless and generally a part of the area is lost.
With adequate clothing frostbite can easily be avoided. Superficial frostbite may be
treated by cupping one's hands and blowing on the affected area, warming from
another warm hand or, with fingers, placing them in your armpits. For more severe
cases, medical aid should be sought.
BLISTERS
Blisters are the painful, and common, result of ill-fitting footwear. At the first sign of
discomfort, remove boots and socks and place a piece of adhesive tape over the
affected area. If it is absolutely necessary, open a blister by first washing the area
thoroughly then inserting a sterilized needle into the side of the blister. Apply
disinfectant and a bandage.
HEADACHES
Headaches are often experienced in the mountains due to inadequate eye protection,
tension in the neck, constipation or "water intoxication", a swelling of the brain tissue
which happens when the hiker has sweated excessively over a period of days and
consumed large quantities of water without taking salt tablets. Aspirin may be used
to alleviate the pain but one should find the source of headache to prevent further
discomfort.
SNAKE BITES
Snake bites are not overly common in British Columbia. One species of venomous
snake, a rattlesnake is found in the dry belt of the southern interior. If you come
across a snake slowly ease back. A snake bite rarely causes death; victims may be
left untreated for up to eight hours.
After an attack occurs:
1. Keep the person calm, reassuring them that bites can be effectively treated in an
emergency room. Restrict movement, and keep the affected area just below heart
level to reduce the flow of venom.
2. Remove any rings or constricting items because the affected area may swell.
Create a loose splint to help restrict movement of the area.
3. If the area of the bite begins to swell and change color, the snake was probably
poisonous.
4. Monitor the person’s vital signs -- temperature, pulse, rate of breathing, blood
pressure. If there are signs of shock (such as paleness), lay the victim flat, raise the
feet about a foot, and cover the victim with a blanket.
5. Get medical help immediately.
BEE STINGS
Bee stings are common and harmless unless you are allergic. Remove the stinger
then apply disinfectant and clod water to reduce the swelling.
A change of diet, dirty cooking utensils or the consumption of tainted water may
result in diarrhea which in turn will cause a loss of nutrients and precious body fluids.
Take extra care in cleanliness and boil water for an additional three to five minutes
to avoid diarrhea.
HYPOTHERMIA
When the temperature of your body falls to a level at which your vital organs can no
longer function you are experiencing hypothermia or exposure sickness.
Hypothermia will develop rapidly and is caused by cold, wet and/or windy weather
that chills the body at a speed faster than it can produce heat. A lack of energyproducing
food and proper clothing will heighten the speed at which hypothermia will
affect you. Always remember to bring extra clothing. It is important to hike at the
speed of the slowest member of your party. Take frequent breaks and keep a close
watch for members experiencing signs of fatigue. Exposure sickness generally occurs
in temperatures of less than 10 C (50 F).
Symptoms are easily recognizable:
1. Feeling cold and constantly exercising to keep warm.
2. Uncontrollable shivering and numbness.
3. Violent shivers. Your mind becomes slow and starts to wander.
4. Violent shivering ceases and muscles begin to stiffen and become un-coordinated.
Exposed skin becomes blue and thoughts are foggy. Victim usually lacks the
capability of realizing how serious the situation is.
5. Pulse and respiration slows.
6. Victim will not respond and becomes unconscious.
7. The section of the brain controlling the heart and lungs ceases functioning.
Treatment must be quick and efficient:
1. Move the victim to a sheltered area, out of the elements.
2. Remove wet clothing and replace with dry clothes and if possible, a
sleeping bag.
3. Wrap warm rocks and place them near the patient.
4. Do not let the victim fall unconscious.
5. Give the victim a warm, non-alcoholic drink.
6. Allow another person in the sleeping bag to share body heat.
7. Exhale warm air near the vicinity of the patients mouth and nose.
HYPERTHERMIA
Hyperthermia is a result of the body being overheated due to increased air
temperature, solar or reflected radiation, poorly ventilated clothing, a low fitness
level or excess bulk.
Symptoms include:
1. Heat cramps may occur and should be treated by moving the victim to a shady
area and supplying water and salt tablets.
2. Heat exhaustion is a mild form of hyperthermia and includes symptoms such as
headache, dizziness, fainting, clammy skin, blurred vision, nausea and vomiting.
Treatment is the same as heat cramps.
3. Heat stroke is the most serious degree of hyperthermia. The victim will have little
or no perspiration, a hot and flushed face, full pulse, and become either apathetic or
aggressive. Cool the victim as quickly as possible paying extra attention to the head,
neck and chest. If the bodies temperature continues to rise, unconsciousness,
delirium, convulsions and ultimately death may occur.
To avoid hyperthermia, avoid strenuous activity on hot days, wear loose clothing and
a hat, drink plenty of fluids and take salt tablets.
