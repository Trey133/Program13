<h2>Description</h2>
<br/>
<h3>Iphone Backup Analyzer (gui) software allows the user to browse through the content of an iPhone/iPad backup made by iTunes (or other software able to perform iOS devicesâ€™ backup). The software is packed with all the routines needed to understand and show the content of files found.</h3>

<br/>
<p>Real name and name in the backup directory</p>
<br/>
<p>File UNIX permissions</p>
<br/>
<p>Data hash (as calculated by iOS)</p>
<br/>
<p>User and group ID</p>
<br/>
<p>Modify time, access time, creation time</p>
<br/>
<p>File type (from magic numbers)</p>
<br/>
<p>Example<p>
<br/>
<p>cyborg@cyborg:~$ sudo ipba</p>
